Two potential  game-changers now affect the evolution of the epidemic: the availability of vaccines and the emergence  of more transmissible virus variants. We combine our compartmental epidemiological model with a new  data-based model of healthcare costs to assess the effect of the vaccination campaign on the future  evolution of the epidemic, in the presence of different NPIs and SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.</td></tr><tr><td>Main findings and limitations</td><td>Even though mass vaccination has started, NPIs remain crucial to control the epidemic, in part owing to  circulation of highly transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2. Stricter restrictions curb transmission more  than faster vaccine rollout. Easing NPIs leads to a surge of infection cases, calling for new closures, thus  triggering intermittent restrictions. Pre-emptive strategies (first Close, then Open at low case numbers)  could drastically reduce hospitalizations and deaths, without aggravating socioeconomic costs, with  respect to a delayed intervention (first Open, then Close to prevent ICU saturation). As with any modeling study, there are inherent limitations. We think that our scenarios are outlined based  on reasonable assumptions, but the actual epidemic evolution will depend on the adopted measures as  well as the possible emergence of other variants.</td></tr><tr><td>Policy implications</td><td>Our findings strongly advocate for the need to keep NPIs in place in the first phase of the vaccination  campaign until sufficient population immunity is reached. We also show the effectiveness of pre-emptive  action: given a finite horizon and Close/Open phases of fixed length, closing first could spare tens of  thousands of lives and reduce healthcare costs without aggravating socioeconomic losses by comparison  with opening first.</td></tr></tbody></table>"
