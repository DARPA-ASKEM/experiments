40671733,Peter,January,2022,Noel‚Äôs place is great.  It‚Äôs spacious for a smaller place. very clean and a great spot in between the two best parts of Rincon.  The Airbnb posting doesn‚Äôt show how nice and spacious the house is.  It easily can accommodate 6+ people. Noel is a terrific host and was great with communicating.   I recommend this his place very much.
40671733,Alyson,January,2022,Noel's place is great. It is very comfortable and in a great location just up the hill from Domes beach. It's about a 10 minute drive to downtown. grocery. Rincon Beach. etc. It is a little tricky to find the first time you go because it is right behind another house so you can't see it from the road. but that makes it really private.  It has two great outdoor seating areas and an awesome extra bathroom that you access from outside. I stayed with my family of 5 and we were totally comfy. I would definitely stay again.
40671733,Mercedes,September,2021,Highly recommended stay in Rincon! We had everything we needed. kitchen especially is well supplied with nice and new things. Extremely clean. no wifi issues. and air conditioning in every bedroom. Noel is a very communicative and helpful host. The outdoor area is lovely as well.
40671733,Phil,August,2021,We stayed here for three weeks and had a small dog and a car and it was great!  Place is very nice. clean. cool location a short few minute drive from lots of restaurants and the owners are great!
40671733,Michelle,July,2021,This was the cleanest. nicest home we have vacationed in.  The host had great communication when we were turned around on the road.  The accommodations were VERY modern and comfortable.  The home is located in a nice neighborhood. close to restaurants. beach. and shops in town.  I would definitely return!
40671733,Jaime,July,2021,Noel's spot was great! The house had everything we needed. The house was spacious. It had: boogie boards/surfboards. beach chairs. cooler. patio with area to sit and relax. outdoor/ second bathroom. and more. The house. located on the west side of Rincon. was only minutes away from the beach. There is also plenty of local places to eat. The spot was awesome. I would definitely recommend this spot. 10/10 experience.
40671733,Susan,July,2021,We had a wonderful month-long stay at Flor de Primavera! Noel was a generous and thoughtful host who helped us throughout our stay. The space was perfect for a group working remotely and offered a beautiful ~5 minute walk to the beach. We enjoyed the ability to surf and live in the peaceful and beautiful Rincon surroundings and hope to come back soon. Thank you. Noel!
40671733,Frances,June,2021,Great location if you want to be close to all the surfing/ snorkeling beaches in Rincon and also close to town.  The house is very comfortable and exactly as pictured. Noel is a great host and replies quickly.  Laundry room was a great plus. Loved that we had wifi to watch movies at the end of a beach day.  Beds were super comfy and a/c in the rooms worked great.  Me and my husband stayed here with 4 teenagers and all were very happy.
40671733,Colin,March,2021,Amazing place! I had a great stay.
40671733,Travis,February,2021,Noel was a great host and the house was perfect. We stayed for almost 2 months. the house felt like home and the price made it a great value compared to other listings. The house is walking distance to Sandy Beach which is just gorgeous. There are lots of cool places to eat in walking distance as well. If you have a car there are lots of cool places to visit in Rincon. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
40671733,Carlos,January,2021,Great little house for a getaway. Only 400 meters from pools surf beach.  Everything spotless clean.  Great porch to relax after a day surfing or doing one if the many amenities in the area. Noel is quick to respond and help with anything at all times.

11258207,Chris,January,2022,Catherine and Nevin‚Äôs place was perfect for our 3 couples with spacious rooms and a fully screened in porch with a panoramic view of the surrounding area. House was very clean with all the amenities we could hope for. Was located a short walk or drive from the beach and several wonderful restaurants. Catherine and Nevin were very welcoming and communicative providing several recommendations.  Wonderful place and wonderful hosts! We look forward to future stays!
11258207,Lorraine,December,2021,Perfect location for our vacation to Rincon. Apartment was immaculate and the view from the screened-in porch was unforgettable. Our hosts had great communication and were very accommodating ‚Äî we would recommend this rental to anyone.
11258207,Liana,January,2020,This apartment was amazing! Clean rooms and amenities. screened-in porch with a beautiful view of the ocean and forest. and great attentive hosts. We had a fantastic time and would rent again!!
11258207,Bev,June,2019,Our stay in Rincon was excellent. The hosts gave us great directions to find the place and met us there. We had no complaints about our stay. Catherine and her husband were very friendly. offering suggestions for places to visit and when we went we were not disappointed. The place was just as advertised and oh so relaxing!  I look forward to coming back. The hosts as well as the place completely sold us on the idea of coming back soon. Thank you Catherine and Nevin!!
11258207,Cindy,April,2019,Our hosts were wonderful and made our families first Rincon experience very memorable. We hope to someday return and enjoy there hospitality again.
11258207,Chris,April,2019,Even better than the pics. Comfiest beds. most gorgeous views and super clean. Cathy and Nevin are outstanding hosts with great local tips. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
11258207,Vickie,March,2019,What a peaceful way to spend an evening after a long day of exploring. sitting on the screened patio listening to the waves crashing and the Coqui frogs. The views are wonderful and the hosts are very caring about their guests and the quality of the stay! Thank you Cathy and Nevin
11258207,Sam,March,2019,"Hospitality was above and beyond. We were going to be flying in at 4am the day of our reservation. and since they had no one staying the night before. were going to allow us to check-in when we arrived that morning. Ended taking the flight the following day which still got us in at 330am. They insisted we call them and let them know when we were 20 minutes out. They gave us specific directions to a popular location near their place. and then told us to call them again when we go there so that they could guide us step by step to their place. They were outside waiting with a flashlight as we made our way down this quaint narrow road. They greeted us with joy and enthusiasm. and walked us to our apartment. When we woke later that morning. the view was triple what was advertised in the photos. Absolutely amazing! The place was spotless. and the beds were VERY comfortable! NOTE: One of the kings spits into two twins. Give them advanced notice and they will have it set up for you. ALSO NOTE: They also suggested the extra ground clearance of a ""compact"" SUV. I can't tell you how much they were right. SO appreciated as some of the roads are fairly narrow and steep. so when you need to share the road in some places with on coming traffic. it is nice to be able to pull off and not destroy the bottom of your vehicle. Also. parking at some of the surf spots require a little off-roading. which the ground clearance is nice for as well.Show more"
11258207,Jessica,February,2019,Great location with an amazing view. The screened in terrace was definitely a highlight and let‚Äôs you enjoy the beauty of Rincon without getting eaten alive from the mosquitoes. Cathy was very accommodating during check in and check out.  Having two bathrooms for this 3 bedroom space is also a highlight. We would definitely come back.
11258207,Response from Catherine,February,2019,Several of Tara‚Äôs comments in her review are worth responding to:   Tara mentions having to ‚Äúback down an extremely steep driveway.‚Äù Our driveway does have a good incline (a slope of about 18-20%). but it is quite manageable. We have never had a complaint about this slope from any other guests. As for our providing off-street parking for 2 cars. with this rental. we certainly did for Tara's group. But. we provide a maximum of 2 spaces. not more. It was when the multiple friends of Tara‚Äôs group came and went from the property. blocking access for other guests. that we asked these friends to park on the street. NOTE: Street parking in Rincon is actually not ‚Äúvery difficult and dangerous.‚Äù as Tara claims. The streets of Rincon can be narrow. so we are happy to be able to offer all of our guests off-street parking; we just can‚Äôt extend that to friends visiting our guests. at the expense of our other guests.  Tara also mentions the fact that we called them regarding the noise they were making one evening. One of the other guests had called us to say that the group above them (Tara‚Äôs) had a large group of people over. and that the group was quite loud. This other guest stated that for right now the noise level was tolerable. but not if it went on late. We called Tara to let her know that one of the other guests was disturbed by the level of noise. and that although we wanted them to enjoy their stay. this should not be at the expense of other guests. On a subsequent night. apparently. the other guest did have to knock on Tara‚Äôs door to ask them to not make so much noise; according to this other guest. that was at midnight.  Tara states that she was ‚Äúput on the spot‚Äù when I texted her to say I was sorry I didn‚Äôt get to meet her when she arrived. and would love to do so at another time‚Äîat her convenience.  Her reaction seems a bit extreme to me. I only wanted to meet her. at a time that was convenient for her. and to clarify who would be staying in our apartment. since she had made a last minute change in the number of guests. This would have taken only a few minutes. The fact that she made it very clear that she did not want to even meet me. one of the hosts of her rental property. struck me as odd.  As everyone knows. there are different kinds of guests. and different kinds of rental properties. Some guests. like Tara‚Äôs group. want to have large gatherings and parties. But our property is not appropriate for that. as is clearly stated on our Airbnb page. Our property is designed as a tranquil retreat‚Äîfor everyone. In two years. we have never had anyone complain that they could not enjoy our apartments appropriately. until Tara‚Äôs stay. According to Tara herself. her overall group consisted of 20 plus people. who wanted to hang out together and party. Given this. it is disingenuous of Tara to rent our apartment for four people. and then complain in her review that we did not approve of her large parties.Show more
11258207,Carolyn,August,2017,Cathy and Nevin's apartment is amazing!  We were sold when we saw the beautiful pictures online but it was even better in person.  The views were breathtaking and my only regret is not allowing more time to just sit on the screened terrace and enjoy the tropical breeze and surroundings.   The apartment was beautifully appointed and no detail was overlooked.  Cathy and Nevin are wonderful hosts.  We arrived late in the evening but they took the time to greet us and give us a full tour.  They provided  information on the local area including maps. restaurant suggestions and fun things to do.  Knowing we were arriving late. they even provided coffee. bagels. juice and fruit for us for the morning.  So thoughtful and very appreciated!  We have so many wonderful memories of our trip including our new friends Cathy and Nevin!  We can't wait to go back next year!
11258207,Rebecca,April,2017,Let's start by how friendly the hosts are! They received us and gave us a tour of the apartment. It is equiped with all the amenities necessary for a perfect long weekend. The beds are extremely comfortable. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
11258207,Terence,April,2017,Cathy and Nevins place is amazing. it is quiet. clean. comfortable. and a great place for us to relax during our stay in Rincon.  The views from this place or amazing. not only did we have an amazing ocean view apartment. we had a great view of the stars at night and we felt as though we were living in the tree tops.  Cathy was very accessible. quickly responding to all of my questions. and she had some great recommendations for things to eat and do while in PR.  I will definitely be staying here again. and recommending all my friends do as well.  One final note power did go out while on our stay. which I found out is a fairly common occurrence in Rincon after talking with some local people.  this was no issue as they had the generator up and running very quickly.
11258207,Jacqueline,March,2017,This hidden gem really made out stay that much better. Clean. quiet. and in a perfect location hidden on the edge of a hill with the rainforest as a perfect view. Hosts were extremely accommodating to our every need. I would definitely stay here again on our next trip!
11258207,Bebe,March,2017,Great location with fabulous views. privacy. peaceful setting close to restaurants. beaches and town. the apartment is thoughtfully designed and well-appointed. our hosts were warm and generous with their time and resources. but respectful of our privacy and plans.  Gave us great tips on eating. beaches. and driving around town and PR in general.  We ope to return someday!
11258207,Paula,March,2017,My husband and I spent 7 weeks in Catherine and Nevin's rooftop apartment. It is as exactly as described. The view is spectacular.. the pictures do not do it justice. Steve the caretaker lives on the property is friendly and available if you need him..  this guy knows hospitality. Catherine and Nevin are caring hosts and this property has been a labor of love for them. No detailed was overlooked.  My husband is an avid diver and they provided him with a set of keys to their shed so that his equipment was safe. Like other guest have stated. parking can be tricky.  Once you figured it out. it's a breeze. Just a half mile down the hill to all the restaurants and beach. Many thanks to Catherine and Nevin
11258207,William,January,2017,Catherine and her husband Nevin were perfect hosts! Nearby at almost all times to answer questions and help us with anything we needed. Parking here is a little tricky. but after one or two times you'll have it down. The condo is a great place! It is open to the outdoors at almost all times which provides great breezes to the home. The AC is in each bedroom and works wonderfully for when you sleep. Bathrooms are great. kitchen is well stocked. Highly recommend the condo!Fairly close to bars and restaurants nearby. you can walk to them. but a vehicle is ideal. especially for beaches.Hope to see her again!
11258207,Gabriela,January,2017,Catherine and Nevin are fantastic hosts. They are very accessible and helpful. Their apartment is fantastic. a peaceful comfortable space. We were a large group staying with small children and there was plenty of space for all of us. The apartment's layout is an open concept with large balconies and retractable french doors. There was a constant breeze and no mosquitoes thanks to the ceiling to floor screens!!! The bedroom had comfortable beds and the air conditioners were top notch. On New Years Eve there was a power outage (for several hours) and fortunately the apartment is equipped with a generator. a rare finding. Puntas is one of the most popular neighborhoods with many restaurants and beaches. yet the apartment is quiet and secluded. Having a car is helpful due to the hills but you could also walk. Beach chairs were available and a cooler. Amazing space for a reasonable price. Highly recommend! Would love to stay again.
11258207,Josh,December,2016,I can't say enough about Cathy and Nevin. and about the amazing time we had at their place. The views are outstanding. it is immaculate and refreshing. the beds are exceptionally comfortable. the AC works great. We made breakfast in the roomy kitchen. and lounged in the livingroom. The open and screened design makes for a breezy and comfortable environment. Our group loved it. The location was ideal for us. right up the road from Puntas and Sandy Beach. but far enough away to have quiet and peaceful night. Catherine and Nevin were terrific hosts. friendly and warm. it is apparent how passionate they are about delivering a quality experience. They should be absolutely trusted with restaurant recommendations. We can't thank them enough for such a sublime stay. and we wholeheartedly encourage you to stay here.
11258207,Josh,December,2016,Come home to this wonderful spot in Rincon. Cathy and Nevin are wonderful hosts and you may just be giving them a big hug when you leave;) The accommodations are top notch. Super comfy bed and all the amenities are high quality. Unbelievable view! When visiting this place. you may feel like you are spending time with family instead of just another business transaction. Thank you Cathy and Nevin. See you soon. Gracias por todo!
11258207,John,July,2016,This was a wonderful place. There is a jungle view on one side and an ocean view on the other. You can sit on the wrap around patio and take it all in. and there are no mosquitos because of the screening. I stayed here for 2 nights with my wife and son and my brother-in-law with his wife and newborn baby. There was room to spare even with all 6 of us! Each bedroom has a huge comfortable bed with great AC and television with Netflix. I live in PR and was amazed that even though we stayed in the dead of summer. we could sit on the patio and be completely comfortable because of the breeze. All the amenities were brand new. modern and clean. I did not meet Nevin but I did meet Catherine. She was a gracious host and extremely friendly. I will definitely return as much as I can and I recommend it highly. You are close to the beach and some really great restaurants. Awesome time. special thanks to the host..

29986056,Manny,December,2019,Waleska was fantastic and super helpful!
29986056,Mirna,July,2019,Beautiful surroundings and gorgeous beach! Villa sleeps 6 comfortably but downstair family/extra bed is way too warm to sleep in. Great communication with host! Overall. we had a wonderful experience!
29986056,Laura,July,2019,Great location. very clean. well kept and equipped. We had an issue with the bedrooms as listed.  It is/was described as a three bedroom villa with AC unit on the rooms upstairs but it was not mentioned that one of the bedrooms was downstairs so it didn‚Äôt have AC. which we found a little tricky and deceiving. As a result. we had to accommodate our party in only two rooms when we were expecting to use all three as marketed. We tried the first night to sleep downstairs but it was very hot so had to move in to the kiddie bunk beds which were not happy about. Other than that. if you are looking to only use the two bedrooms upstairs it is a great villa.
29986056,Jennifer,February,2019,Was an excellent space for my family. Waleska was super helpful with specific needs I had. Would highly recommend!
29986056,Skye,February,2019,Our stay was awesome. Great location close to everything. Steps from the beach and a very roomy house.

41554419,Steven,March,2020,This is the perfect place to stay at in Rincon! It is only a 5-minute drive from the center of town. beaches. stores. the local dive shop and more. plus you get the benefit of enjoying beautiful countryside surroundings in a comfortable setting. It was especially enjoyable for us to hear the coqui frogs at night and to swim in the pool.  The space is kind of a boutique hotel with common outdoor spaces. and it was very quiet and relaxed while we were there.

52183827,Jan Michael (JM),October,2022,We had an excellent stay. The bedrooms were very comfortable. there was a lot of open space. which was great. and the location was perfect for a weekend getaway. Experienced minor setbacks with electrical appliances (A/C. ceiling fans. and TV). but overall utilities were great.
52183827,Bhargavi,August,2022,Had a delightful stay here. The photos are accurate depiction of the house. Communication was very responsive. Very clean and great location. Would love to be back.
52183827,Juan,July,2022,I have stayed several times in Rinc√¥n with my family and Villa Descalza has been the best all around experience. If you have a car. I will definitely recommend staying at Villa Descalza. You will be within 10 minutes of the town center or any of the best beaches you can find. Sandy beach is at 1 minute from the house. I was aliarle bit worried because I read several reviews were it was described a problem with the water pressure. we stayed for two weeks and not once we experience a problem with water pressure. The house is well equipped. I will definitely be back at Villa Descalza in the near future.
52183827,Gillian,July,2022,What an amazing find. Very clean and comfortable. Located on a peaceful street with spectacular views.  We enjoyed our time there immensely. Would definitely visit again and recommend to friends and family.
52183827,Roy,July,2022,Great place. Great location. 2 minutes from the beach.
52183827,Juan,July,2022,The home was beautiful and in excellent location. We had a wonderful family vacation. The place was clean. charming and with everything you need to enjoy Rincon. Fantastic beach near by!  We will visit again!
52183827,Raquel,June,2022,Villa Descalza is the perfect place to relax. Extremely clean and organized. The villa has everything you may need to make your stay an amazing one. Just a few minutes away from everything. In addition. West Indies makes it so easy to check-in and out as well as excellent communication. Will stay again!
52183827,Anuja,June,2022,Delightful place to stay/vacation in Rincon. We loved all the comforts and little touches of hospitality welcoming us. Perfect for a beach vacation for a family of 4 or 5. We would love to return.
52183827,Vane,June,2022,Villa Descalza was amazing. Cleaning was impecable. The house is very comfortable for a family. The house is very well equipped. My kids loved playing in the backyard and I loved relaxing on the terrace. I am already planning my next vacation there. If you find this house available don‚Äôt think about twice because it‚Äôs a rare find!! 100% recommended
52183827,T,June,2022,Beautiful home with all the amenities. Safe location close to the beach and Tamboo restaurant. Quick drive to downtown Rincon and many other restaurants. grocery stores. other beaches and shops. Well stocked kitchen. big closets and amazing outdoor patio with comfy seating.  Our only complaint was the extremely low water pressure in the master shower.
52183827,Felipe,April,2022,We absolutely loved our stay. The house is beautiful and perfectly located. Communication was clear and prompt. We will definitely stay again.
52183827,Gary,March,2022,This was a great place.  The house is comfortable. and only a two minute drive to Sandy Beach.  The view is nice and there is good outside hanging space.  Would definitely rent there again.  Only potential downside is if you want to be right on the beach/be able to walk to the beach.  You could walk but it's a long hill and would take some time in the heat.  But the beach area could be noisy so there are some downsides there as well.  Jan (property manager) was super helpful. and there is tons to do in Rincon.  Thanks!
52183827,Jessi,November,2021,Super clean property in a great location near Sandy Beach and close to a ton of Rincon‚Äôs best attractions. Great WiFi and ideal for working remotely. Would definitely stay again!

2665387,Nick,November,2021,This place is great! I stayed for a quick surf trip and I don‚Äôt think I could have picked a better place. The view from the deck is as advertised and the place was clean. comfortable. and in a great location. I would highly recommend staying here. If it‚Äôs available the next time I visit Rincon I‚Äôm booking it for sure!
2665387,Stephanie,September,2021,Great place to stay if your looking for a quiet place and great views!
2665387,Leonard,July,2021,This place is great honestly the view is amazing The power did go out but we did get reimbursed correctly
2665387,Sarah,June,2021,Tim was very helpful and responsive. He recommended several places we should check out in the area.
2665387,James,May,2021,This is one of those places you don't want to tell anyone about because you want to keep it all to yourself. Fun apartment. spectacular views. close to the beach and downtown Rincon (5 minutes tops drive). Shh. don't tell anyone else!
2665387,Alex,November,2020,We had a very difficult stay at Tim‚Äôs place in Rinc√≥n. We had already been in Rinc√≥n for 3 weeks at a great apartment on Airbnb and were looking forward to the endless views at Tim‚Äôs place.When we arrived there was a security alarm going off in our apartment. which we didn‚Äôt manage to turn off for over a day. Tim was very unresponsive and his solution was for us to remove the system off the wall and cut electrical wires.The next day the power went out. which  we know happens on the island. While most Airbnb‚Äôs in the area have generators or solar power to use as back ups. Tim‚Äôs property does not and his listing does not warn of prolonged blackouts. Further. we didn‚Äôt hear from Tim for days and had no choice but to wait it out. In total we spent 3 days without power. On top of that security alarms began going off in the other units on the property. to which we didn‚Äôt have access. For three days it sounded like there were trucks backing up outside our window. Made it very difficult to sleep. Our groceries spoiled. forcing us to throw everything out and incur additional expenses in dining out. We had to spend our days hopping from cafe to cafe with our laptops. which made us feel very uncomfortable considering Puerto Rico was in the midst of a lockdown due to the covid pandemic. In addition to this. I would say the space needs an all around upgrade. The views are beautiful. but the lamp in our room was cracked and the furniture is really barebones. We love Rinc√≥n. but can not recommend this space. There are better listings at comparable rates.Show more
2665387,Ruben,August,2020,The purpose of my trip as a local resident of PR was to leave the metro area for some rest and quiet time. The house location was great for that purpose. It is near the beach and the whole town of Rinc√≥n. Even with some restrictions due to Covid my experience was awsome. I am definitely come back to this property. It was very clean. very close to everything that you need. So come down and explore the west side of the island.
2665387,Barbara,July,2020,The view is absolutely amazing. We had breakfast outside every morning. And at night the stars and sounds of the coqui are wonderful. A bit of a hike to the little beach but totally worth it. Do some grocery shopping on your way there and enjoy the space. The dessert rose is a great spot . look into the hours of operation and walk over to grab lunch. Tim is a great host .
2665387,Ana,February,2020,Sparkling clean and the perfect location with beautiful views.
2665387,Laura,February,2020,Beautiful set up on the hill with amazing views. Quiet. simple place with everything you need for a chill vacation.
2665387,Collin,January,2020,Tim was great and very quick with responses. He allowed us to check in a few hours early. The house had everything we needed and the view was amazing. The house is just outside of town and just a few minute drive to all the surfing locations. It was exactly what we were looking for.
2665387,Cassandra,November,2019,It's me again! Just can't say enough about the peace and quiet. The views are so beyond what I can put into words. Sitting and watching the butterflies with those water and mountain views has been so wonderful for me! Thank you for having us!
2665387,Cassandra,October,2019,Absolutely love love love staying here. The views are AMAZING. it's so very peaceful. and you have everything you need to stay. Plenty of towels. sheets.  pots and pans. plates and utensils. Washer and dryer.Some fun board games. Very clean. They even have a bath tub which you don't see a lot here. in my experience. Communication is excellent. My favorite thing to do is sit on the patio looking at the views of the water and mountains. the butterflies playing. and the birds. Within minutes of the beautiful Steps beach. Town is very close.I almost didn't leave reviews because I want to keep this lil gem to myself to stay in again but I had to be honest about how fabulous it is! Hope to be there again soon!
2665387,Cassandra,August,2019,Absolutely beautiful views. Really really have enjoyed sitting on the patio enjoying them. Minutes away from amazing beaches. Far enough away from the main road for it to be very peaceful and 5 minutes from downtown. Everything is really clean. plenty of sheets/towels. pots/pans. silverware/plates etc. Everything it's says it will be and more.  Would for sure stay again.
2665387,Chris,July,2019,Tim's place was fantastic! Set up at the top of the hills in Rincon. it offered beautiful views and quick access to a variety of awesome beaches and really great restaurants. We relaxed on the deck overlooking the ocean. watching the sun set. and listened to the sounds of the coqui as night fell. There was a gorgeous mango tree with giant ripe mangos that had been picked and left for us by the previous guests. We also had access to a star fruit tree. and both were delicious. The two bedroom two bath penthouse is such a great value for the money. easily shared by two couples without getting in each others hair. Less than a 5 minute drive to Steps beach and Domes beach. and only 30 minutes to Crashboat beach. Soooo many good restaurants close by as well. Tamboo. Pool Bar Sushi. and the Beach House for breakfast or late night drinks. This is an awesome place to relax and take it slow while enjoying the best Rincon has to offer.
2665387,Karen,June,2019,You can expect stunning vistas from this top floor unit. It is also fabulous to be a 1-minute walk from The English Rose which has fabulous breakfast. friendly staff. and serves as a good landmark for finding Tim‚Äôs place. If you like the seclusion. the quiet beauty of the nature up in the hills and the views of the sea. this is a great place for you... because we have teenagers that want walking accessibility to beach and town this was only good for a couple days entertainment for us. Tim was very responsive and hospitable. There was no outside light working when we arrived at night and the security system kept beeping. but Tim quickly addressed these minor things by sending someone to attend to them the next morning.
2665387,Jose,April,2019,This place was better than our expectations. The view it can‚Äôt be described in any other way than amazing. You will find everything you need for your stay. The apartment is incredibly clean. And Tim (the host) answers me  quickly every time that I contacted him.
2665387,Greta,March,2019,Beautiful location. great house with fully equipped kitchen.  off the beaten path and extremely private but minutes from the heart of surfing and other activities.
2665387,Jonathon,March,2019,What an amazing view! I definitely recommend!
2665387,Juan,March,2019,Great views from the top of the hillside overlooking steps beach just a short drive away. The house had everything we needed and more and the owner/host Tim was very easy going and also flexible with our later  checkout time request. Additionally the house is Walking distance to the English rose and very close driving distance to dogmans. Maria‚Äôs. and domes beach. Great value and recommended!
2665387,Serghei,February,2019,Wow. this look from the balcony it‚Äôs amazing!!!every morning i was feeling really happy to enjoy my coffee with such unbelievable view. phenomenal!Place its spacious. loots of room in the living area and also has a big table outside under the roof on the balcony area. we got some little water issues. i guess its town problem. but the rest was really good!
2665387,Monica,January,2019,AMAZING!!The house is extremely comfortable. Spacious communal areas (open kitchen. big livingroom and balcony). Comfortable beds and good air conditioning in both rooms. Also. the fact that it has 2 bathrooms is very convenient when staying with a group. Its perfect for families or group of friends. Very spacious communal areas. The kitchen is more than fully equipped (even 2 fridges!!). Favorite extras were: board games. binoculars and yoga mats. Ocean view is superb!! It is 3 mins walk from The English Rose (great restaurant for brunch) and 3 mins drive to one of the fewest beaches you can snorkle in Rincon. The road to the house is a narrow steep hillI so you need to be a bit careful while driving. But once you drive through it twice. you'll get use to it. I Strongly recommend this property!!!
2665387,Alejandro,April,2017,Tim's place is amazing. It has probably one of the best views of Rinc√≥n. Great house. calm area. perfect for family and friends. Great place to see the sunset.
2665387,Marilyn,January,2016,"We called Kim's place. ""the treehouse"" because it is nestled above the tree line overlooking a wonderful ocean view and a constant breeze.  Very quiet and private.  Kim made it very easy to check in and check out."
2665387,Cole,July,2015,I looked at a ton of places before I went down. There was a lot of availability. I know the area. and I was very indecisive. I'm so happy we decided to stay with Kim. Gorgeous place. unreal views. a really well built. and homey feeling place. Windows all over. island breezes blowing through. If you sleep in the master you wake up looking at the ocean. The wrap around deck is perfectly situated. and amazing for breakfast looking at the ocean and watching the sunset. There is a mango tree in the yard. beach chairs. fins snorkels and a ton of beach gear. There is also a keyboard in the house. Huge bonus. as I play piano. The road is definitely skinny and steep. but so are 90% of the roads in rincon. If you're not super comfy behind the wheel just be aware of this. Kim was super responsive. The place is a quick drive to steps beach. that has great snorkeling. and a quick drive to surfing and other beaches. Can't stress how much we loved our time. Would not hesitate to stay again. and would recommend it to my best of friends and family. not just the air bnb community. Thanks Kim!!
2665387,Phil And Demitra,January,2015,Myself and my group enjoyed our stay at Kim's space! The views from the deck were beautiful! The outdoor dining table was exactly what we needed. The kitchen was stocked with supplies. the game closet was packed. and their was even yoga mats and foam rollers. After longs days in the ocean and hiking. it was so nice to come back to a comfortable place that really felt like home. The beds and sheets are comfortable. Kim and Tim were very attentive and responsive when we had questions. We would gladly return! Thanks again!
51332564,Lauren,April,2022,Waleska was a lovely host.  Incredibly easy to get in touch with‚Ä¶warm and welcoming. The house worked well for two families (8 people total). and we always had everything that we needed ‚Äî kitchen items. bedding. beach chairs. towels and even a wagon. We would enjoy the beach which was steps away from the condo. and swim in the tide pools at sunset. We walked (6min) to the large pool. And also enjoyed walking down the beach to have a poolside lunch at Casa Isle√±a. The condo is also a 10-15 minute drive from Isla Made (amazing coffee & artisan goods). Tamboo (Oceanside dinner). snorkeling at Steps Beach. We had a phenomenal time. Coming back to Waleska‚Äôs home after each outing was always wonderful. Thank you Waleska!
51332564,Sarah,April,2022,Beautiful rental in Rincon and just as described although the photos don't do it justice and the place is even nicer in person.  The kitchen is well stocked if you want to cook at home. The location is perfect- right on a beautiful beach. although the waves were too big during our stay for me to let the kids play in the ocean.  Restaurants and excursions in Rincon are just a few minutes drive. We had a great time and would definitely stay at Waleska's place again!
51332564,Laura,April,2022,This Airbnb was perfect for three moms and daughters. Location is right by parking and a 1 minute walk to ocean and just a little longer walk to the pool. All reviews have been accurate. A beautiful home with plenty of towels. beach chairs. umbrellas. even a beach bag. The tide pool is perfect for kids. Beach has lots of fun sea glass to gather. Delicious restaurant 10 minute walk down the beach as well as a spot to rent paddle/surf boards. Short drive to a swimming beach. Overall an awesome stay.
51332564,Elizabeth,March,2022,Can‚Äôt recommend Waleska‚Äôs place highly enough. We (husband and me) stayed here with our 2 grown children and 86-year-old mother. Only 1-2 minute walk to beach.  Words to describe decor: modern charm. spacious. serene. happy and bright. All bedrooms have French doors so you can hear waves at night. and awake to sounds of birds in morning. Spectacular sunsets at night from roof deck. Kitchen equipped with everything we needed. There‚Äôs a wonderful restaurant 10 minutes walk down the beach where we had brunch one day and a wonderful dinner the last night. One of our best. most relaxing and fun family vacations ever. which is saying a lot. Highest recommendation.
51332564,Sarah,March,2022,The BEST place for kids. We had a beautiful and nourishing stay.
51332564,Aaron,February,2022,My husband and I were traveling for the first time with our twin infants and to say we were stressed out was an understatement! Between the manager. Waleska. and the owner. Johnny. all of our worries were put to rest. The unit itself is clean and well stocked- and we were pleasantly surprised to find extra diapers and baby wipes in one of the bathroom cabinets. We will definitely be staying here again. we can't thank our hosts enough for a wonderful stay!
51332564,Nestor,February,2022,Excellent property. impeccable. enviable central location and steps from the sea...Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

547854074378980886,Doris,July,2022,Daniel went above and beyond to accommodate us and the place and location was great.  We really enjoyed our stay.

547854074378980886,Wissem,April,2022,Good Location!
547854074378980886,Eliza,February,2022,Clean. spare room in the Punta Taino guest house that‚Äôs in walking distance of coffee. a small convenience store. and Sandy Beach. Beware that the guesthouse is across the street from a bar that plays super loud music late into the night on weekends. Daniel was super nice and very responsive over text and phone. and accommodated our super late check-in (2 am). The AC worked really well and there were no bugs in the room.
547854074378980886,Sarah,February,2022,Great location in Puntas. Daniel was very helpful with directions and recommendations for resources and food around the island. He helped me add on an additional night when travel plans changed. The location is close to the beach. walkable to Tamboo. Jakes Java. Kahuna Bar. Caf√© Isle√±a. Barefoot Yoga. and more.
547854074378980886,Lauren,February,2022,Timeless elegance in a relaxing setting on the beach - Daniel‚Äôs place has everything you need for a Rincon vacation stay. In a great location. right near heaps of great places to eat! Daniel and his staff were very accommodating and helpful and would check in regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. The villa itself was stunning from the oversized hanging ferns to the coral lined pool deck - Would definitely stay here again! If you‚Äôre looking for a place to stay in Rincon without having to drive everywhere this is it!
547854074378980886,Kristyn,February,2022,Great location. Clean place. 1 minute walk to the beach and to restaurants. A popular bar called kohuna is right across the street which is convenient just gets a little loud at night if you plan to go to sleep early
547854074378980886,Jessica,January,2022,"Can't beat the location and the host was super nice and friendly. Only complaint is that the pool was ""open"" for only a few hours during the day. We'd get back from surfing around 3:30/4:00 ready to hop in and rinse off but it would already be closed for the night."
547854074378980886,Joey,January,2022,Beautiful Place. Extremely Clean. A/C Pumps .Good Location. Walking Distance to the beach/Bars & Restaurants. Daniel is Top Notch an Awesome host. Makes you feel at home/Very Comfortable. Quick to Respond if I had any Questions. Thanks for a great stay.

51213807,Amita,November,2022,This host and this property is now in my top 3!  Allison and Debbie are rock stars. We arrived late but it didn‚Äôt matter because the level of care that was done for us was impeccable.  The property is architectural digest like!  High end luxury.  The view and the nature sounds in the early day time was music to our ears from the hustle and bustle of city life and heading up businesses. . Allison and Debbie knew the perfect spots for us to eat in the area and the last minute Chef plug was icing on a 7 tier cake !  We are ready for the next adventure in Puerto Rico already and Allison is the first name on our host list .  Thank you more than you know
51213807,Janalys,September,2022,This house is worth every penny. Every detail in this house is perfect. It has everything you need and the most beautiful views for a wonderful stay in Rincon ! It is near shops. restaurants  and the most beautiful beaches.
51213807,Ari,May,2022,Great house in a great location. Very modern and very well managed and maintained.
51213807,Maria,March,2022,This is the best Airbnb I‚Äôve ever stayed in. First of all. the photos do not do the views and the beauty of this property justice! We were in awe. The space is extremely clean and had every amenity we could want/need. The property manager was also very attentive and communicative throughout our stay. We even extended one night because it was just too perfect. Would come back and also book Allison‚Äôs other properties.

652223851823345173,Juliana,September,2022,We had a lovely weekend stay -- wish we had been able to stay longer. House is quiet and very private as advertised. We loved the salt water pool and you can see the ocean from the deck. Just a few minutes drive to the beach. Very restful and tranquil. Of note house is off grid and there's a nice yard with fruit trees where the kids were able to play safely. Check-in/out were very easy and communication with hosts was great. Look forward to returning one day
652223851823345173,Andreas,August,2022,LOVELY!The house was as tranquil as promised. Absolutely lovely. And Leanne made it all so easy. Thank you for the great stay. My guests all commented on how great it was and were impressed. Can't wait to come back!
652223851823345173,Elite,July,2022,It‚Äôs a nice place. very private. The pool was very nice. Some maintenance issues that need addressing. Solar powered. be prepared for power loss on cloudy days. Hosts were very nice and responsive.
2702087,Shang,December,2022,Great central location and easy to find. Checking in and out was easy and hosts were always responsive. Fulfilled the need for a clean bed to get a restful night's sleep. Kitchen had necessary items to make basic meals as well. One word of caution for those less physically able. it is 4 flights up. Definitely got my steps in. especially when I forgot something. Would not hesitate to stay again!
2702087,Maria,November,2022,Love the place; very clean and cozy.
2702087,Lawrence,September,2022,Great stay for the value. Really close to the beach in the center of everything

2702087,Ryan,March,2022,The apartment was exactly as described and was well located in Rinc√≥n.  Marcos had great communication and it was a pleasure to stay in the airbnb.
2702087,Greg,March,2022,Great place and location. Easy access to anywhere in Rincon.
2702087,Birin,February,2022,A hidden PRIME location. If you‚Äôre going to Rincon this is the place to stay. Very homey. spacious. and located literal steps to the beach.
2702087,Alionka,January,2022,This was a great Airbnb! As other reviews have mentioned. it‚Äôs a 4th floor walk up. That being said. it still felt totally worth it because of the private balcony and it‚Äôs proximity to both the beach and to town! A/Cs in the rooms were also fantastic. and Marcos was incredibly helpful!
2702087,Mei-Ling,January,2022,Amazing location !!!
2702087,Charles,October,2021,Great location and great place!
2702087,Daniel,September,2021,beautiful view of the mountains in Rincon. easy access to the beach and everything is very close. Rincon is small and it's my hometown. i decided to be a tourist for once üòÜ. wish I could stay. recommend for anyone looking to spend their time at the beach.
2702087,Jessica,August,2021,Great stay.  its perfect to spend your night and visit lots of places at the west coast.  it was clean. Marcos was awesome communicating with us while we stayed when we had questions.  highly recommendedthis stay!  Thanks Marcos!
2702087,Laurel,June,2021,Nice. convenient location with good AC. This close to the beach you won‚Äôt be there too often! Nice that it had a full kitchen and aloe stocked in the fridge!
2702087,Victoria,June,2021,Everything all you need.
2702087,Sherwood,March,2021,I highly recommend Marcos's place for your stay in Rincon!Location - really convenient. The apartment is VERY close to the beach... like a two minute walk. It's great being right next to Villa Cofresi for drinks on the beach during the day. or an easy place to get drinks or dinner at nights. Even though Rincon is a place where it's ideal to have a car. there are many places within walking distance from the apartment. including the town square area. Apartment - lovely. and equipped with everything you need for your stay. I stayed for a month. and the second bedroom was great for when I had guests. but it would be great if you have kids too. For those not familiar with Rincon. the beach by this apartment is great for kids as the water is calm and quiet (especially in the winter compared to other nearby spots.)  Having a private balcony is great too. A bit of troubleshooting the internet at first. but Marcos was great and got it running. I was working from home the whole month and able to work from the apartment no problem! Also - though this is not at all important to me. it seems to be a big deal to other Airbnb reviewers - the water pressure is excellent. Host - Marcos was a great host and communicator by phone or text whenever needed! His parents live in the apartment underneath and though they spend a lot of their nearby farm. I was lucky to meet his father several times who was just the most incredible person - so kind and helpful. He brought me lots of fruit and other surprises from the farm. and I learned so much from him :) I would absolutely stay here again if I visit Rincon again!Show more
2702087,Jody,December,2020,We spent three weeks working remotely from Marcos‚Äô place and had a wonderful time. The internet worked well. with only one 15 minute interruption during the entire stay (better than some of my coworkers in NYC). Marcos‚Äô mom. Iris. was very helpful and friendly. a truly wonderful person.  The beach by the apartment had nice sand and was usually calm for swimming with our 5yr old. Hotel Cofresi staff and restaurant were very convenient with nice strong drinks.
2702087,Michael,November,2020,Great. Clean and very close to the beach. Awesome for the whole family. I recommend it to anyone.
2702087,Jessibeth,November,2020,We had a great time. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The place is right beside the Villa Cofresi Hotel. were you can have a great time. Also is conveniently located close to a few beaches.
2702087,Jeannie,October,2019,"Marco's apartment is great for a couple of days' stay at the beach.  The AC units were quiet and cold. The place was clean. Our challenge was that 2 hours before our check-in. Marcos emailed to let me know that AirBnB had ""made a mistake"" and double booked the room. This meant that we were given a neighbor's apartment. that was filled with her personal stuff. including the refrigerator being more than half-filled with her food. We were very disappointed. Marcos did his best to make it right. We were able to move the next day. and Marcos and the local person. Iris. were very accommodating in making sure we had a good stay. I would recommend that you triple check your reservation to make sure you are getting the place you have reserved."
2702087,Mike,July,2019,Stayed 3 days at Marco‚Äôs place and had a great experience. The condo is right across the street from the Villa Cofresi hotel and we had access to the game room. the beach. and the pool tables. There was also live music at the hotel and great atmosphere at the bar area. There was a great bakery close to the condo that had wonderful breakfast. sandwiches and sweet treats. all for a great price. Overall. it was worth it. I highly recommend this place. Thank you Marcos!
2702087,Sonia,July,2019,This was a small but cozy apartment. It was very clean and near the beach and other Rinc√≥n amenities.
2702087,Janice,July,2019,Marco's place was sparkling clean. very nicely decorated and very comfortable for our family of four. The place is great if you have children. Highly recommended!
2702087,Elizabeth,May,2019,Marco‚Äôs place was great! We had everything we needed. Very clean and comfortable! Hot water. air conditioner in the rooms. Tv for the children. Walking distance to the beach. they had toys for the children to play in the beach. All kitchen amenities that we needed. The condo community has a shower area to clean off the sand and they also have dryer and washer( $1.00 in quarters needed). We felt very safe and got responses quick for anything we needed. It was truly perfect for us. Thanks Marcos and his sweet parents for all the help!
2702087,Hugo,May,2019,We had a great time at Marco‚Äôs place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located and although it‚Äôs a lively neighborhood the apartment is very quiet! Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
2702087,Beliza,July,2018,This place is conveniently located next to Villa Cofres√≠. which has a very family oriented night life. It has all the essentials. and the host is very attentive. The only downside is that it is on a fourth floor. I didn't mind since it was a good workout. but it might be inconvenient for someone who has issues with that many stairs. If you are in Rinc√≥n on a Thursday evening  or Sunday morning. don't forget to go to the market on the main plaza just a short drive from the apt!
2702087,Mariluz,July,2018,Most enjoyable place I‚Äôve ever stayed. Super clean. friendly and an absolute at home like feeling. They go above and beyond to make it your home. Ivy was super friendly and just amazing. Can not recommend enough. Only thing i suggest is not renting the 4th floor if your not a young bull as it‚Äôs many steps. Couldn‚Äôt ask for anything better thank you Marco and Ivy
2702087,Ben,June,2018,Excellent location close to everything that you need. Iris was a great host and available as needed
2702087,Santos,April,2018,A very awesome spot!!!
2702087,M√©lissa,January,2018,Marcos' father Tino may be one of the nicest host I have ever have on Airbnb. He made us feel welcomed and almost at home. It was fun to chat with him. The area is very great. very close to the beach and to town. It feeled very safe at night. I would go back anytime.
2702087,Jennifer,August,2017,Excellent location. Right in front of Villa Cofres√≠. they have awesome night live. Very close to the central plaza. art walk and organic market. Very clean apartment!
2702087,Carey,April,2017,Such a wonderful experience from beginning to end! The condo was exactly as described and provided more than everything we needed for our week stay! The location was perfect for adults and children. being only steps away from the resort and beach. Communication with the host was very easy when arriving . Iris and her husband are SO sweet. and were beyond helpful with any questions we had about the area. I could've sat and talked with her for hours!! :) I absolutely recommend this place. the price is almost a steal! Thank you SO much for the perfect hospitality during our stay! We will be back asap!!
2702087,Artem,April,2017,All of the reviews are spot on. This place is perfect for families or friends. Came here with 2 friends for a surf trip. had an amazing time. Iris is easy to reach for any issues. Book this place immediately. completely worth it.
2702087,Jennifer,March,2017,This was a great landing place for my family's short week in Puerto Rico. A very clean space with all the comfort we needed and beach d√©cor that made me feel I was finally on my much-needed vacation! It was our home base for a gorgeous day at the beach. It's a stone's throw away and accessed through a beautiful hotel's open-air lobby. The apartment has all the amenities in the kitchen for cooking. air conditioners in each of the two bedrooms. a television. and the closets have an abundance of handy items to spend a great day at the beach - toys for kids. etc. The ample parking lot outside is enclosed by a remote control gate so that was a plus for our rental car. Marcos was an outstanding communicator as was Iris who lives one floor below and who made herself available at the deepest hour of night for our arrival. She was wonderful to talk to and shared the best bananas straight from their farm!  The living space is very narrow and you will need to eat at the counter but this was the only element I can point to that might make a group greater than 3 feel squeezed. But who wants to stay indoors?  I would stay here again.
2702087,Jae,March,2017,Very accommodating. clean place to stay during your visits to PR. Will definitely come here again in the future.
2702087,Kimbra,December,2016,This is a small apartment that‚Äôs perfect for a family. Iris. the host‚Äôs mother who lives on the property is absolutely fabulous and so concerned about her guest‚Äôs having everything they need. The apartment was well outfitted with everything from fluffy towels and laundry detergent to pots. pans. coffee pot. and an air conditioner in each room. The full kitchen is very small. but clean and tidy and it has everything we needed to cook all of our meals. For guests with small kids there are beach toys. a porta-crib. beach chairs. Laundry facilities are very nice. which was a big help to us after a few days at the beach! The apartment building has its own gated parking lot which is right across from the hotel parking lot. Security is very good. especially because the hotel parking attendants are there until late at night. We could walk right through the hotel lobby and outdoor bar (or around it) to get to the beach. The beach is perfect for young kids as is the hotel arcade. Although there‚Äôs not much night life for older teens in Rincon. two pool tables at the hotel bar helped keep them occupied at night. Right at the end of the driveway into the hotel complex and apartment buildings is a 7-11 type convenience store. a dive shop and a liquor store. A few fruit stands are within walking distance. Although the road doesn‚Äôt feel all that friendly to walkers. it‚Äôs OK. Two grocery stores are less than a mile away. ‚ÄúDowntown‚Äù Rincon is a very short drive‚Äîmaybe 5 minutes. I must say. though. Rincon is not a quiet place. and neither is this location. Car horns going off at all hours kept us up. but we do like to keep our windows open. When we closed them and turned on the A/C. we couldn‚Äôt hear the outside noise.For us. one of the high points of our stay in Rincon was meeting the hosts. Marcos‚Äôs mother and father are incredibly warm. friendly and fun people. If they offer to show you their farm. by all means GO!! Show more
2702087,Gerry,June,2016,I had a great experience staying at Marco's place. It had all you needed and more for our family stay. The apartment was very well cleaned. in good conditions and beds are very comfortable. I will recommend it ...5 stars stay.
2702087,Kamron,September,2015,Great location steps from the beach. Nice apartment and safe.
2702087,Jose,November,2021,I recommend it! This is our second time staying in this apartment. The apartment is located in a residential building with two towers. each with four floors. It has private parking and offers maximum security. The place has everything you need to enjoy a great vacation. Fully equipped apartment from the kitchen to its two bedrooms. Very good cleanliness. The furnishings are in excellent condition. Its location in front of the stall allows you to enjoy the beachfront restaurant and snack bar facilities. A quiet place perfect for resting and enjoying. The beach is about 100 meters away and is a beautiful beach. Thank you for everything Marcos always available to answer all my questions. I recommend this accommodation for both internal tourism and any tourist who visits our island.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

712131215966607648,Autumn,December,2022,Loved this place! Wish we could have stayed longer! Pool with a beautiful view! Would highly recommend!
13556699,Response from Dianna,November,2022,Thank you again for staying with us! You were a great guest! I take all your suggestions seriously.  Thank you! Dianna
13556699,John,October,2022,Beautiful property. Love the location.
13556699,Graham And Trish,August,2022,Wonderful host!  Wonderful location!  Friendly locals!  All around great time!
13556699,Charles,August,2022,Great place for a family getaway with outstanding amenities and an excellent host.
13556699,Emily,June,2022,Dianna was a fabulous host. Incredibly responsive and accommodating. When we felt lazy we enjoyed the pool and upper patio at our Waterfalls lodging - they are both fabulous outdoor spaces. The house was also in an amazing location in Rincon - close to the beach and within walking distance of great restaurants.
13556699,Response from Dianna,June,2022,Thanks for that info! We will check it out!
13556699,Jake,June,2022,We went as a group of 17 for my brother‚Äôs 40th birthday and this was the perfect location and we rented out the entire property. Having so many bedrooms with only one bed in them was essential to everyone enjoying their stays. It‚Äôs a rare find to find so many bedrooms and bathrooms that aren‚Äôt trying to stack people in like cord wood. If you ever need a large group venue this is your place to go! Communication was amazing and easy. views and access to activities was superb. and the neighborhood was warm and upbeat. And when you‚Äôre in the pool. the view is such that you don‚Äôt even realize you are in a neighborhood at all. I have stayed in a number of airbnbs and this is by far the best experience I‚Äôve ever had.
13556699,Nick,May,2022,Had a great Stay at Dianna's property!  We had a group of couples and the accommodations were perfect.  A quick walk to Sandy Beach East. some fun bars and restaurants close by. and a mini mart to get iced coffee and the basics.  Dianna was always quick to respond to any inquiry both before and during our stay which is always greatly appreciated. I would definitely return!
13556699,Tom,March,2022,This house perfectly accommodated our group. It‚Äôs spacious and clean with lovely outdoor spaces. Diana was very friendly and easy to communicate with. Highly recommend!
13556699,Alexandra,January,2022,We enjoyed our stay! Quiet location that‚Äôs still accessible to all of Rincon‚Äôs greatest spots.
13556699,Robert,September,2021,The house and the location were absolutely wonderful. The only issue was the power went out. including the a/c and the fridge (which was stocked). The host and the maintenance person seemed more annoyed than helpful when we raised this point. It took the maintenance man several hours before he showed up drunk and rude to switch on the generator. This was the only negative of the trip. Everything else was wonderful
13556699,Nelysabel,September,2021,Everything was awesome. so clean. the house is bigger than it look in the app. the pictures doesn't give justice to the place. We had some light problem because of what's going on in PR with the electric company. but Dianna responded really fast and got Robert with us when ever we needed him. they have a power supply for all the house 1st. 2nd and 3rd floor!! Very attentive and nice they both were. The air conditioning. the pool. the rooms. the kitchen. Im mean. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING!! I'll definitely make all the arrangements to go again. Thanks for the opportunity ü•∞
13556699,Angel,August,2021,This is a great stay! Beautiful grounds. nice location. Great for large families.
13556699,Desiree,July,2021,This place is so beautiful and close to the beach. It is a large and safe space for large families.  Diana was so very kind and accommodating. She brought a a high chair over for the baby in our party. We will definitely stay there again next time we visit.
13556699,Ivy,June,2021,It was a great stay. in a spacious and very clean place. the facilites of the property were good. The communication with Dianna was excellent.  There was not much nightlife around. but by car you can reach several places nearby such as the town of Rinc√≥n and other areas. Important. insect repellent is a must.
13556699,Response from Dianna,June,2021,Thanks Tayna!  Totally enjoyed hosting your group!   Dianna
13556699,Emma,June,2021,We rented Diannas house for my Bachelorette weekend - the location and house were fantastic. Communication was tricky at times. especially because our flight got in in the middle of the night. All in all. it was a great Airbnb - loved the pool!
13556699,Response from Dianna,May,2021,I am happy you had a good time! I wish I was there! Hope to see you again soon!  Dianna
13556699,Anmaris,April,2021,Nice place to stay with family! Dianna is a very good host.
13556699,Samantha,April,2021,You can expect breath taking views and the time of your life!
13556699,G,October,2020,First and foremost I would like to say the WiFi in this place was very poor we were not able to reach out to out love ones when needed too. We was left with no garbage bags to put our trash away. Not to mention the clean up crew arrived wayyyy before our check out time. As we left to purchase cleaning supplies and garbage bags .  we send a family member to collect all extra groceries we purchase . They didn‚Äôt give us time to clean and commented ugly comments about the place Better WiFi and garbage bags would be a great add on to this place of stay. Other than the bad service this would be a beautiful stay
13556699,Sean,October,2020,Prime location. very big house and everything was very clean .
13556699,Kevin,October,2020,Great place to stay. rooms are very clean and good. The only bad i will say is the 120 stairs you have to walk to get to the third floor but other than that great place to stay i will 100% recomended to my friends.
13556699,Agnieszka,September,2020,Absolutely amazing home. Great location. Everything was sparkling clean and beautifully set up. Hosts have everything you may need in the home and are quick to respond! Would definitely stay again!
13556699,Response from Dianna,August,2020,Hope you made it home safely! Thanks again for taking care of our house! Hope to see you again soon!

13556699,Dianna's house is wonderful! The usual amenities. such as kitchen and others. are all good. The location is very nice. with great views and walking to and/or near the beach. One of our favorite aspects of the house is the shared common space with a waterfall that sometimes attracts beautiful birds. including a brightly colored troupial. Hammocks. comfortable chairs. and a large tv (for sports fans) make for a gathering space with a terrific ambience.We were there during the earthquake episodes in early,January,2020,. The house is sound. and you haven nothing to worry about there.Dianna notes in her explanation that there is live music nearby. so just be aware that during certain times of the year the music can be heard from the house. particularly on weekends. Thankfully. air conditioning and thick walls help to mute/eliminate the sound indoors.You will have a wonderful time at this listing!Show more

13556699,Donna,December,2019,Dianna‚Äôs place had everything we had expected and more. One of the great things about it is the location. The location is perfect for a crowd. when trying to figure out who wants to do what when. Plenty to do within walking distance. beach. restaurants. coffee shop. gift shops. bagel shop. bars with live music or hang at the house in the beautiful 3rd floor veranda with hammocks and ‚Äúspot‚Äù the iguanas in the trees or sit poolside.
13556699,Evelyn,November,2019,The property is just like it looks on photos.  Looks beautiful at night. Dianna and Rob were great.  Check in was easy.  Safe location..a bit noisy at night from the bar close by.  The only negative thing was limited sun at the pool area.  Highly recommend.

We will definitely be back!!!
13556699,Paul,May,2019,This area is amazing because it has all the amenities needed but not in a packed town square area. Beach. bars. and food all a stones throw.

Thank you for everything!! ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
47596916,Wendy,July,2022,Unfortunately. we were not able to stay at Coralis‚Äôs place through no fault of hers. Somehow Airbnb allowed us to book her place even though it was already booked. Coralis‚Äôs called us immediately and apologized and promptly refunded our money. We were super excited to stay at her place as we saw the actual building and it looked beautiful! Hopefully. we will one day be able to stay at her place!!

If you do not like nature sounds. brings some ear plugs. but for me- there‚Äôs nothing better than falling asleep listening to coqui frogs and waking up to the roosters. Thanks allison for helping us with little questions all week and an amazing stay!
20206312,Ale,January,2021,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!! This house is beautiful. well designed and decorated. The open layout and distancing between the suits makes it very comfortable for everyone. The pool and property are even better in person! I will definitely comeback üòä I stayed for 3 days at casa Barrilitos with my friends over the weekend. And we all loved the house! The pool is amazing with a gorgeous sunrise view. The ocean and waves and visible from the property. There was no noice or any house to close so it feels private. The BBQ area was great too. all the AC units worked perfectly. Kitchen is well equipped. Communication with Allison was perfect. She responded instantly to all my questions. Checking was super easy! This house deserves a 6 stars!! Allison thank you for everything! I look forward to staying with you again.
20206312,Victor,December,2020,Great stay . house have everything needed for the family .
20206312,Jean,December,2020,Had a blast here on my 40th bday weekend. Amazing house and great experience. 100% Recommended. Thank You Allison
20206312,Mark,May,2020,Lovely and super comfortable house. Allison is very responsive and her instructions are very detailed. which was much appreciated.  The house has everything you need if you plan to visit local beaches (almost a 10 minute ride to the nearest beaches) and we enjoyed the pool and the ocean view every day!  Will definitely stay again.
20206312,Kyle,March,2020,This property is absolutely amazing. The location. views. and amenities are unbeatable. Rincon is a great town and I think it‚Äôs safe to say we‚Äôll look to stay at Casa Barrilito again on our next vacation there!
20206312,Response from Allison,March,2020,We have a water softener getting installed today with a water filtration system for the house that should help reduce the sediment and calcium in the lines. as well replacing the inline water heaters.  If that doesn't do the trick we will call in an exorcist ; )Show more
20206312,Kathy,February,2020,House is great! Spacious and comfortable. Excellent panoramic views. We were a family with 6 adults and four children and there was always a place to sit and relax. Beautiful pool. plenty of beach chairs. umbrellas. and snorkeling equipment. Close to beaches. shops & restaurants. Allison responds to all texts immediately and is very accommodating. She even delivered an umbrella base when I mentioned one wasn‚Äôt working properly. Kitchen is well appointed and we stayed in and cooked several nights! Outdoor kitchen. dining space is wonderful with a table that can easily seat 10-12.  We opted to have the cleaning service come everyday and she cleaned the kitchen and bathrooms and made the beds. It was well worth it. The only criticism we had was that the hot water was sporadic for showering. It was difficult to regulate the water temperature and most times water would be scalding and then cold. All in all we had a fantastic week at Casa Barrilita and will be back!
20206312,Adnan & Aisha,January,2020,Fantastic place in Rincon! Great for groups or family. Spectacular view and pool. and very spacious.
20206312,Margaret,January,2020,Casa Barrilito was amazing. Beautiful space. tons of beds. stocked with any kitchen accessory or beach gear you could need. and in a great location. The highlight is definitely the pool with built in bar seats. The binder in the house was also awesome and had suggestions for anything you could possibly need to know about the town (places to eat. where to get groceries. nightlife. day time activities. etc.) We visited during a week with many earthquakes which threw a few curveballs into our trip (power outages. water shortage. etc.). Our host Allison was incredible. She came multiple times to check on the space. answered messages at all hours of the night. and was extremely accommodating. Her hospitality and thoughtfulness made our trip. We were able to relax and enjoy beautiful Rincon knowing that we had a host who was on top of an issues that we had along the way. If I have the opportunity to visit again. I will only stay at one of Allison's places knowing that she will take care of any unexpected things during the vacation.
20206312,Alberto,January,2020,Not enough good things to say about this place!! It was amazing!  The house is absolutely amazing feels like you are in a luxury resort! The pool and views were beautiful. Sparkling clean and all the extra amenities were an added bonus! The beds were very comfortable. The house decor is thoughtfully put together. Allison has everything you can need for a beach vacation. Chairs. coolers etc Check in is very easy the location is quiet and peaceful. The house fit our large family comfortably we will definitely be back next time we are in Rincon.
20206312,Kathy,January,2020,Beautiful home - amazing views
20206312,Wendy,November,2019,Spectacular home! Pictures do not do this incredible home justice. The views are absolutely stunning. the pool perfection and the rooms spacious. warm and inviting. Plush towels were a welcome after a day in the beach and pool. Allison is immediately available by phone or text.  So looking forward to another stay in 2020!
20206312,Ariana,October,2019,Casa Barrilito is absolutely amazing!Comfortable enough for a big group. The place is very modern and stylish. and has an outstanding view of the ocean. Has all the basic amenities and more. No need to go out. You have everything you could need and want inside the house. Beautiful.

20206312,Mara,August,2019,Awesome house. Great views.
20206312,Wendell,August,2019,Casa Barrilito far exceeded every guests expectations including ours. It‚Äôs like a hidden oasis. The backdrop for the beautiful oceanside and palm trees made our small wedding an unforgettable event. Allison was very responsive and adaptive to the changes and communication that occurred over the year leading up to our booking.
20206312,Kate,July,2019,This how was stunning. Allison is a super host for a reason. She answers all questions rapidly and hosts a beautiful space. Highly recommend!

20206312,Luis,June,2019,This place knocked it out of the park! If you‚Äôre looking to stay in Rincon. look no further than Casa Barilitos. The pictures advertised on this posting does not do this place justice. The space is large enough to be with a large group of people and not feel crammed. In addition. the place was sheen. tidy and had touches all over the house; beach towels. beach equipment. board games. speakers for you connect your phone to. etc. I would absolutely stay at this house again. and actually am looking forward to it. 100% recommend!
20206312,Hector,May,2019,Impeccable. brand new house. Amazing views. Allison thank you so much for your hospitality. What a fabulous house! We loved the tasteful decor and thoughtful touches trough out the house. You thought of everything!
20206312,Response from Allison,May,2019,Thanks for the lovely review!  We're thrilled you enjoyed your stay at Casa Barrilito.   You got to experience our roads and hills firsthand.  They are very steep and windy!   I'm not sure what photo you are referring to with the two beds.  The only photo we have with two beds is the bunk bed and that is exactly what it looks like.   We don't claim to nor do we misrepresent any of the bedrooms and the bed situation.   Regardless. it sounds like everyone had plenty of space to spread out and sleep comfortably.  We hope you come back again.  You and your family were wonderful guests and very respectful of our home and we thank you for that!Show more
20206312,Kathleen,April,2019,Beautiful home. great location. and had everything we needed! Allison was quick to respond if we had any questions!
20206312,Jayna,April,2019,This home is a perfect space for 2 families. We had 4 adults and 5 kids (could have had more!) and we all had plenty of space and privacy. The view is incredible and Allison is the most responsive and helpful host we‚Äôve met. I miss the sound of roosters and tree frogs already. ‚ù§Ô∏è
20206312,Nona,March,2019,The house was beautiful inside and out.  Plenty of room for our group of 14. including 4 llittle ones. Perfect place for a family vacation.  No need to bring much.   The amenities were excellent.   We loved it.
20206312,Christal,March,2019,The view from pretty much everywhere in the house is breathtaking. I had a group of 14 and we all slept confortable and we had more than enough space throughout the house. Everything was perfect. amenities on point and super clean. So if you have if you have a big group visiting Rincon. this is the house for you.
20206312,Stan,January,2019,the place was absolutely fantastic close to everything. house design as such that you don't have to run into all your friends constantly which is a good thing when a bunch of you are staying Under One Roof! Alison is on top of everything should you have any needs.
20206312,Response from Allison,November,2018,Thanks for the great review Gilles.  It was a pleasure hosting you.  We hope you come back to visit us again soon.

20206312,Audrey,May,2018,Hands down the most beautiful. well-equipped place we have ever stayed anywhere in the world. including top hotels. If you have a chance to book here. do it. Allison is responsive. thorough. helpful and an all-around wonderful host. The house even has tons of snorkel gear. beach chairs. coolers. condiments. everything you could possibly need.The only negative to note is that there is a house being built up the hill with construction noise starting around 6 am. If you‚Äôre a deep sleeper or early riser you won‚Äôt even notice. And who really wants to sleep late when there‚Äôs so much to see and enjoy?!?
20206312,Nicole,May,2018,Wonderful stay. great location.
20206312,Amanda,May,2018,Casa Barrilito is one of the most beautiful homes we've ever seen in Puerto Rico. Everything about our stay was excellent. My family enjoyed every moment! I would highly recommend anyone who's going to be in Rincon to book a stay at this home you won't regret it!
20206312,Ileana,May,2018,Beautiful property with an excelent location. Highly recommended!

20206312,Lucas,April,2018,Just Amazing. between the views. the airy open spaces. the pool. and fabulous indoor and outdoor kitchen. you don't even need to leave that stylish pad. No place like it. Highly recommend it. Allison. the host. was extremely helpful and accommodating. We will be back
20206312,Guillaume,March,2018,Amazing house with a breathtaking view of the hills and the ocean in the background. Highly recommended if you want to stay in Rincon and feel the Surf !
20206312,Ryan,March,2018,Amazing stay! Beautiful home with outstanding views. Close to the beach and some restaurants.
20206312,Tom,March,2018,We had a great time at Case Barrilitos. The house clean and and modern and is bigger than it looks in the pictures. Plenty of space. the pool is great the views are unreal. Allison was very quick to respond to any questions we had. We accidentally broke an end table (and reimbursed her for) when we were packing up. and Allison was understanding.  This is an amazing house at a great location with all of the amenities you need.
20206312,Adel√≠n,February,2018,We had a great time! Everything was cleaned and organized. The house was fully stocked and we only brought food and some music! Allison answered every message pretty quick and was very attentive.
20206312,Joe,January,2018,Great place. beautiful home. amazing with the details and a fast responding host. It was a perfect stay. Higly recommended!
20206312,Christopher,January,2018,Such a beautiful and relaxing house. Rincon has some great things to do but we didn‚Äôt want to leave the house. Worth every penny. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
20206312,Maria,December,2017,The house is undersold by the pictures listed. and the house is much more spacious and beautiful than hinted at by the pictures. The rooms are all comfortable and pleasant. Allison was incredibly attentive and answered all messages quickly.However. the cost of the house did not change despite not having access to all ammenities listed (AC. hot water) because the house was running on a generator. Written instructions for using the generator would have been useful. and phone contacts for gas companies and the local property manager. Although the house was amazing and Allison was a great host. the lack of access to all the ammenities makes it so that I cannot give the stay five stars. Understandibly. and as a local. I know that post hurricane expectations have to be lowered. but when we booked the house we were told we would have power. AC. and hot water.I would definitely recommend this house to anybody wishing to visit. I think it was the best option for a large group.Show more
20206312,Regina,April,2021,Casa Barrilito... it is a delicious stay to rest and enjoy as a group. My family is big and everyone can be in their space. It has a good wifi connection inside and outside the house.  We had a great time at the pool. enjoyed the panoramic view. the sunrise and sunset is spectacular. Quiet place. no road noise can be heard. The rooms have ocean views. We cook like chefs...its kitchen is well equipped. In short. the house is very nice. We'll be back. Allison!Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

The ""host"" is very attentive. helpful and diligent with any need! Highly recommended! I will never forget this place!Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original"
19438634,Brian,December,2022,This place was so peaceful and well manicured. Exactly as the photos portrayed sans the bunnies :). Rincon is one of my favorite destinations and the Puntas side is surely a little quieter. While I came for the surf the landscaping was very impressive. As a gardener I enjoyed looking at all of the tropical plants on the grounds and may have to steal a few of their ideas. Our host was very responsive although we really didn‚Äôt need a thing besides a few recommendations as one of the restaurants moved. I will surely recommend this spot to my friends and family.
19438634,Ana,November,2022,Awesome stay at Greg's. It's our third time staying there. and has become our go-to when we travel to Rincon. The property is really special. quiet and serene with an unparalleled view and a lovely semi-private pool. It's also super central: a 2 min drive to Sandy Beach. and it's cool eateries. We'll be back!
19438634,Katie,October,2022,10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary in Rincon. We stayed at Greg's sanctuary and cannot say enough good things! The views are stunning. the location is perfect and close to everything. and Greg is a great host with tons of helpful information. Can't wait to go back!
19438634,Ruben,September,2022,We recently stayed at Tres Palmas loft. and this place is magic. The apartment and the property were clean. beautiful. and quiet. The backyard and pool are just gorgeous. Just a few minutes from the beaches. bars. and restaurants. Greg and Diane were very attentive and responsive.
19438634,Dwiniris,August,2022,Lovely loft! Amazing ambience and safe!!
19438634,Luis,July,2022,A peaceful place. excellent host and very flexible check in/out. This is out 3rd time in this place and every time we go we enjoy a lot more. Thanks Greg for the hospitality!
19438634,Jeffrey,June,2022,Greg‚Äôs place is awesome! We had a great time. It was very convenient to get to anywhere in Rincon from his place. I was super impressed with the mature tropical landscaping and how well manicured the backyard yard is. AC works great and cools the unit quickly. Sea views from the patio and pool. Would love to return and would definitely recommend!
19438634,Yessenia,June,2022,Great place ! Greg was extremely nice !
19438634,Rachel,June,2022,We had such a lovely stay! Highly recommend! Close to beach and option of lounging by the pool. hard to beat. Resident bunny an extra perk.

19438634,Suzannah,May,2022,A really nice space on a beautiful property. The kind that you actually want to spend time at. Located close enough to restaurants and beaches that you can walk to. But also a short drive to lots of other great stuff. Highly recommend! Host was communicative and great to work with as well.
19438634,Kristin,April,2022,Perfect in every way! Would not hesitant to recommend both the accommodations and location. A (very) short drive to numerous restaurants and beaches. You can walk but the roads are a little precarious (narrow and very hilly/steep) Do not hesitate to book for a wonderful relaxing vacation!
19438634,Briana,March,2022,This place is five star all the way. Location is great. offering good views. beautiful backyard. quite. but not far from anything you want or need. The place was very spacious. very clean. and stocked with exactly what you need for fun in Rincon. Communication was instant and helpful. Checkin was a breeze. Off street parking was a huge plus. The bunnies were fun to play with every morning and nothing beat sitting on the patio after a long day in the sun. Will be back for sure to stay at this gem.
19438634,David,February,2022,This is the second time that we booked Greg‚Äôs place.Again we had an amazing time me . my wife and my two kids.It‚Äôs a perfect location. walking distance from the beach. surf spots .restaurants‚Ä¶The place is super clean and has everything you need.The view is just outstanding.The pool is perfect for chilling out.This the best place and the best host in Rincon;-)David

19438634,Dusya,October,2021,Villa Diane is a beautiful place with incredible views. super nice and thoughtful hosts and the most comfortable accommodations. You‚Äôre close enough to the beach to hear the waves. yet the pool and the apartment are comfortable if you‚Äôre working remotely. which is what i was doing. We stayed at the Tres Palmas apartment. and we loved it.
19438634,Hafsa,October,2021,Had a blast staying at Tres Palmas. thank you for having us! We will be back!
19438634,Liesel,October,2021,A beautiful stay in Rincon! Everything was perfect and the house/ space / outdoor is more beautiful than the pictures provided. The bed is HUGE and the house has everything you can need. We reached out to Greg with a question once in our week stay and he got back to us so quickly. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!
19438634,Andrew,September,2021,This Airbnb is very well equipped with everything that you need. Way better than being in a hotel. having the kitchen. washer/dryer. pool steps away. and on a quiet mountain street. Gorgeous views straight over the forest to the ocean. Contact-less check in. everything was very clean upon our arrival. Beach chairs available for use during our stay. great list of local-approved recommendations ready to go. Friendly. responsive. and helpful host. No trouble finding it per his instructions and actual off-street parking a huge plus. I definitely will recommend this place (and his other apartment in the same building) to you reading this or any of my friends and family. We will definitely stay here again.
19438634,Michelle,September,2021,Awesome place to stay! The place is comfortable and really peaceful in a quiet and safe neighborhood. The views are amazing and the pool super clean. Close to restaurants. I recommend it to anyone who wants a relaxing weekend in Rinc√≥n!
19438634,Nell,September,2021,What an incredible experience! The layout of the home was exceptionally thought out- from the build to the cute little touches. The morning views were incredible from the loft bed- which was very comfortable.The outdoor space was so private and relaxing. The pool!! We spent so much time decompressing by and in the pool. The views of the ocean and rolling hills while floating in the pool are surreal.Christina and Greg were so accommodating. They made it feel (in the best ways) like staying with friends. We will absolutely visit them again.The street is private and quiet. The grounds are meticulous. The location is central to beaches. restaurants. bars. and is maybe a 10 min drive to downtown Rincon.Perfect stay- thank you Christina and Greg!
19438634,Brittany,August,2021,This place was amazing! It was clean and beautiful. It was perfectly located and very serene and relaxing. We wish we could have stayed longer.

19438634,Thomas,May,2021,Would definitely recommend. Very clean. great views. nice pool. and not far from good restaurants. Rincon is not the most walkable. so definitely recommend having a car. Would recommend Surf Pizza Wagon. Jack‚Äôs Shack. and Cosecha nearby for food.

19438634,Yannis,February,2021,This was hands down one of the best places I stayed. including a lotof high end hotels.Greg was very responsive and answered all questions both before and after I booked and was always on site and always helpful.The place is on a hill at a quiet neighborhood and it has a great view of the ocean and the valley.The apartment was very clean and open with a decent size kitchen. a big stove. microwave. coffee maker and blender. a nice comfortable couch in the living room and a very comfy king bed on the second floor.My favorite thing about the place though was the pool where I ended spending most of the time.I can‚Äôt wait to go back to Rincon and I will def be staying with Greg again if the place is available.
19438634,Gina,January,2021,My husband and I visit Rincon regularly.  Spent New Years and absolutely loved the property and location.  Close to Sandy beach.  Beautiful view of the ocean and lovely outdoor area. The pool area was so relaxing and spotless. Perfect to be lounging all day.  Liked all the christmas lights surrounding the property. Had all the amenities and super comfy bed.  We had a great time.  Thanks Greg!!

19438634,Christian,December,2020,Absolutely perfect. everything as advertised and more!
19438634,√Ångel Daniel,December,2020,"I have enjoyed several experiences in properties through this platform in Puerto Rico and abroad. However. our stay at Greg's home has been incomparable. Every detail deeply thought out to please the guest is unmatched. We call it ""the Paradise House"". You will have absolutely everything you need for the best getaway. Thanks Greg."
19438634,Pavle,November,2020,Greg‚Äôs place is an absolute treasure. So good that one wants to keep this gem to themselves. I had an extended stay for month+ and all the amenities one needs to work remote are here. Superb PR get away.
19438634,Koko,September,2020,Greg and Christina's place was beautiful. The view from their airbnb is breath taking. The beach was super close by. My boyfriend and I was able to get to steps beach within 3 mins of driving (we drove because of all the hills that we didn't want to walk up). Steps beach is blocked off from cars but you can walk on the beach and swim. I was able to do some snorkeling at the beach.
19438634,Melissa,September,2020,Very nice loft. warm and clean private pool. beautiful view
19438634,Joseph,August,2020,The apartment was everything we needed to spend a great birthday weekend. The pool was so refreshing we couldn‚Äôt help but getting into it every time that we could. And the tranquility throughout the stay was just what we needed. Thank you for a great stay!
19438634,Raul,August,2020,Wow. Tres Palmas was like a taste of paradise and a dream combined. Super clean upon arrival. Everything you need is 5-7-10 minute drive on the cool hills of Rincon. Greg was not an intrusive host and was very welcoming. We‚Äôll definitely book this home again. Cheers
19438634,Alex,August,2020,The place was amazing. The views were stunning. The location for a novice might be tough to get to but worth it. Greg was an excellent host. He suggested great restaurants like Mangia Mia and the Rincon Beer Co. I would definitely book again.
19438634,Eriel,August,2020,We had an amazing time in Villa Diane. Everything was just as advertised and spotless. Thank you Greg for all your help regarding our visit and for going the extra mile regarding our safety during the pandemic. We greatly appreciate it.
19438634,Carlos,July 20,2010,/10
19438634,Edwin,July,2020,We had a great time. The pool was for ourselves and everything as expected! Thanks Greg
19438634,Viviana,July,2020,This space is amazing. 100% recommended. Thanks for beautiful and peaceful space.
19438634,Ramon,June,2020,The place is amazing. The owner is very helpful great person. Can't wait to go back. Great experience
19438634,Alexandra,March,2020,Such a beautiful view. thank you for an unforgettable weekend!
19438634,Brian,February,2020,Greg's place on the hill offers amazing views of Rincon. and is close to a number of restaurants. bars. cafes. and beaches. From the king bed you can see palm trees dancing in the breeze. There is a nice plunge pool to cool off after a day in the sun. The apartment itself is clean and modern and nicely decorated. Greg was even kind enough to leave some Medalla and a cold Brita in the fridge for us. Definitely a great place to stay for a couple or a young family.
19438634,Diana,February,2020,The house is located on a hill with the breathtaking views.  that provide the upmost privacy. Gorgeous beach and restaurants are within walking distance. The host was accommodating to our early checkin request.  as our flight arrived early in the morning. I can‚Äôt compliment this place enough. Definitely will be back!
19438634,Kristine,January,2020,This is a lovely unit in the Puntas area of Rincon near Sandy Beach facing west with a great view. lovely pool.  The space was perfect for the 2 of us.  Great to have a king bed. Well appointed kitchen and very smart. modern space with easy steps to the bed in the loft.   This unit is in impeccable. clean and well-maintained condition.  And Greg is a great guy.  Hope to be back next year.
19438634,Claudine,January,2020,We totally enjoyed our stay in Gregs apartment. The view is amazing and the apartment is very good equiped. There are a lot of good food spots only a short drive away. The only one problem was that we only stayed 4 nights :(
19438634,Jamie,December,2019,Greg‚Äôs loft apartment was even better than we expected.  The pool was beautiful. sunny all day and has a nice shallow area perfect for small children or relaxing in the water. Well positioned umbrellas too in case we wanted a little shade.  The view is beautiful.  The unit itself is extremely well maintained. super clean and the bed and the couch were very comfortable. The TV has a lot of premium cable channels in English which was a nice treat for our daughters.  We really enjoyed that Greg and Christina live on site.  They were immediately available if you needed them but at the same time we felt like we had the place to ourselves.  They have designed the entrances to the two units and their house so that you never really bump into one another which adds to the sense of privacy. We have rented 5 different properties in Rincon over the years and this is definitely our favorite.  We will be back for sure!
19438634,Samary,December,2019,Highly recommended!! Very peaceful and place!! The best weekend in my life and Greg was an excellent host!
19438634,Joey,October,2019,An amazing house and location for Rincon visitors.  Pool is the perfect size and temperature.   Everything is so clean and easy to find.  Safe community.  Close to beach. bars and local attractions.
19438634,Rebecca,September,2019,This amazing Loft will leave you wanting To live here forever!   Thank you Greg for being an amazing host and communicating with us when we got lost!! Lol
19438634,Andrea,August,2019,Wow! Just wow! What an amazing and beautiful place this is. Truly the best I‚Äôve stayed in Rincon. Greg was an awesome host. location is spectacular. and with great amenities such as the pool with the beautiful view you won‚Äôt want to go far. We will most definitely be back very soon! Thanks Greg!
19438634,Claude,August,2019,Greg's villa is of the best Airbnb locations I have ever stayed at. Everything was excellent from the bedrooms to the pool. I saw other places in Rincon while I was there. and I came away even happier with the choice I made. The property is peaceful. relaxing. safe. centrally located. and overall just great!
19438634,Miriam,July,2019,This place is great! Very clean and close to many things! People are so friendly. we had a great time!
19438634,Tanisha,July,2019,We have visited Puerto Rico and Rinc√≥n many times. and this was unquestionably the best place we‚Äôve stayed.The place was beautiful. the view was beautiful. the pool was amazing. the amenities were great. the location is a 3-10 minute drive from anything you want to do. and Greg is a fantastic host.This is a special spot. and we can‚Äôt wait to stay again when we return to Rinc√≥n!
19438634,Elba,June,2019,This is one of the best places I‚Äôve stayed in. It is stylish. with a very charming touch; sparkling clean. and the view is amazing. Greg is a great host and communication was always excellent.  Definitely a beautiful place to go back!
19438634,Luis,May,2019,It is a beautiful place with great views and a great vibe. Very close to the beach and very private. 5 stars all the way.
19438634,Carmen,May,2019,This is my second time staying here and I would definitely recommend it. The place is amazing. Greg is a super host making sure you have everything you need for a great stay.  Great location.  calm. amazing view and walking distance to the beach and restaurants.
19438634,Lauren,May,2019,Tranquil and lovely.
19438634,Matt,May,2019,Greg‚Äôs place is Awesome! Beautiful views. Pool was fantastic!  Great restaurants located near by. Will be back!
19438634,Ann,April,2019,One of our favorite stays in Rincon. Terrific views of the ocean. Very clean. bright and well appointed. The bed was comfortable and our host very accessible. We'd definitely return!
19438634,Moraima,April,2019,Lovely. calm and quiet place! Excellent choice to stay any time of the year! Extra clean. Loved the pool area. just steps away. I definitely recommend it!
19438634,Danielle,March,2019,Wow!  I loved this place and I fell in love with Rincon. The location is great. up the hill from Sandy beach and lots of amazing food.  Just a short drive to everything Rincon has to offer.  The villa is so peaceful! I would recommend and stay again.
19438634,Betsy,March,2019,We had a great stay at the Villa Diane Tres Palmas apartment.  It is spacious. modern. bright. airy. and clean. We actually left the windows open and the AC off the whole time. We thought it was one of the best locations in the Rincon area - just up the hill from Sandy Beach. Pools Beach. and lots of great bars and restaurants. We had coffee and a smoothie from Jake's Java stand every morning and enjoyed them on the beach. We ate at Pool Bar Sushi three times. Casa Islena twice. and several other places within easy walking distance. The view from the apartment and pool is beautiful. One unexpected perk was the parking. Our friends' AirB&Bs had some pretty tiny and treacherous parking off the tiny winding hilltop roads. while our parking at the Villa Diane was easy and spacious. Greg was a good host with quick answers to any questions we had.  The lockbox worked great for our late-night checkin. We would HIGHLY recommend a stay at the Villa Diane!
19438634,Response from Greg,February,2019,Thank you very much for all the kind words! You all were such a pleasure to host and look forward to y‚Äôall getting back here again soon. Thanks again Jamie!
19438634,Chelsea,January,2019,The location was perfect. A hilly 5-10 minute walk to Sandy Beach and bars. or a 1 minute drive. makes it removed from the beach front crowd while still having all the perks. A true tranquil vacation spot for relaxation. meditation. swimming and breath-taking views. Greg was very accommodating. kind and friendly. Lastly. so many fresh towels! Easy. clean. cozy and turn key. exactly how an AirBnb should be.
19438634,Jonathan,January,2019,Perfect apartment for quick surfing getaway. It has all the amenities you need. Awesome view from the pool and balcony.
19438634,Dayna,December,2018,Wow! Greg‚Äôs place is one of my favorite air b n bs visited yet. The amazing salt water pool is perfect to enjoy in between beach/ surf sessions. The apartment itself was super clean. with everything one might need. cooking included. The bed was super comfy and the apt has beautiful windows. Speaking of views. the view from the backyard is stunning. With a well manicured yard. sporting different species of palm trees. I made myself coffee and watched the sunrise every morning(Will miss this). Greg himself also made him self completely available and was very accommodating. This place is a perfect representation of how clean and fresh rincon is! Close to all surfing beaches and restaurants. We will be back!
19438634,AnneMarie,December,2018,Villa Diane is beautiful. It‚Äôs just like the photos. The view is breathtaking and you can even hear the waves crashing from below. Close to nightlife. surfing. yoga of the area but your own little retreat! The location is very close to the beach if you are a surfer (it is elevated so recommend driving down to the beach‚Äî2 min). Pool Bar Sushi. Casa Verde and Tamboo to name a few. Also only a 10 min drive into the city of Rinc√≥n. If you are around on a Thursday night check out the local artisan market in the town square. It‚Äôs a great place to stay and there are many day trips nearby. You‚Äôll need a car and we recommend grocery shopping for breakfast items and cooking. The kitchen has everything you need. There were so many towels for both showering and beach. Literally 4 giant beach towels.  There were also beach chairs available to use. There was shampoo. conditioner and body wash in the shower. The king bed is very comfortable and has great linens. We really had everything we needed. We were very comfortable and would stay here again! Thanks. Greg!
19438634,Alexis,November,2018,If you're in Rinc√≥n this is an excellent location at a great value. Highly recommended. Great host's.
19438634,Patricia,October,2018,A great place to stay when in Rincon. Close to all the action. with a fabulous view.
19438634,Luis,October,2018,The place is beautiful and very clean. the pool and grounds are also very beautiful. Greg was a great host. The reason I downgraded the place was because of two very large window panes without curtains or blackout...other windows have thin curtains and no blackout as well.  If you are like me that cannot sleep in very bright rooms then this one is not for you. If you dont mind waking up at 6am (sunrise) to a very bright room then you will really enjoy the place because there is nothing else wrong with the place. Host cancelled my second day and gave me credit....great host!!
19438634,Angie,October,2018,My husband and I absolutely loved Greg's place. The location is perfect - close to all the beaches and several dining options. The house was impeccably clean with beautiful views and great amenities. Greg provided several beach towels. a beach bag. and all the other essentials you would expect at a hotel. It was also great having the pool. and the views can't be beat. The house is well designed. well air-conditioned. and comfortable. Greg was also quick to respond if we ever needed anything. I would highly recommend staying at Greg's place and would definitely love to go back if we're in the area next year!
19438634,Zulma,October,2018,This was not our first time staying at Greg‚Äôs place and let me tell you: this place is a little piece of paradise. everything from the check in to the pool. the space. the AC. EVERYTHING IS OUTSTANDING! Definitely our favorite place to stay in Rinc√≥n. Five stars!  -Z&M
19438634,Joe,September,2018,The place is set up perfectly for a stay in Rincon and the host is super friendly and has deep knowledge of the area.Highly recommended
19438634,Rafael,August,2018,What an awesome place! The view. the amenities. the location. I mean Rincon is the best spot for a getaway in the island but Greg‚Äôs spot makes it much better! Just beautiful!
19438634,Angel,August,2018,perfect place for relaxation and close to the beach
19438634,Max,July,2018,Our stay exceeded our expectations. The host was super responsive. Even tho he wasn‚Äôt in Puerto Rico. he was very helpful and left us to the care of Angelo. who attended our requests and helped us during our stay. The view is amazing and the accommodations clean and comfortable. The villa is near the beach. bar and restaurants. We will definitely book again.
19438634,Breanna,April,2018,Greg‚Äôs home is AMAZING! Prime location So close to all the good surf spots and restaurants.
19438634,Katie,April,2018,What a beautiful spot!  We were hesitant to stay somewhere other than right on the beach like we have in the past.  However. during the trip. we said to each other multiple times that we definitely made the right decision in choosing Greg‚Äôs place!  We loved hanging out in the backyard. enjoying the pool or watching the sunset from the porch.  Plus it was still very close to many bars. restaurants. and beaches!  Greg was so helpful and kind!  We would highly recommend his place!
19438634,Bethany,March,2018,Absolutely beautiful place and in a great location. Everything was clean and we had more amenities than we planned on having. Greg was a great host. We couldn't have had a better trip. I highly recommend his place!
19438634,Katri,January,2018,We had a great time here! Close to everything you‚Äôd want to visit but a nice quiet place to relax with a great host. We stayed post-hurricane and had a great time.... electricity and hot water as promised! Can‚Äôt wait to come back.
19438634,Brette,July,2017,Great property & host. Everything about the place was wonderful.

I dare say that it is the most complete accommodation where we have stayed in PR. it has everything. bbq. full kitchen. washing machine. It's a paradise near Sandy Beach where you won't want to leave. In addition. the host thought of every detail to make your stay an unparalleled one.

Little bar right behind the beach house right on the beach that ends early. so no noise or traffic.  15 min walking distance to the main plaza ( food and drinks).  And lots of restaurants!  The beach behind the house is a little rocky but if you walk down the shore you will find sandy beaches.  The water was amazing to swim in!  I would definitely stay there again.

25743456,Jorge,May,2021,Excellent house. Many amenities in the house and the community. Very close to the beach and town.  The last day we walked all the way to the town square via the beach and had breakfast there. will definitely recommend it.
25743456,Valerie,May,2021,this rental was exactly what we needed. The rental is literally steps from the beach and lots of great beach shacks and paddle boarding and surfing lessons.
25743456,Novanglian,May,2021,Very cool place and location on the west coast of Puerto Rico.  Nice outdoor decks for both floors of the place.  Juan was EXCELLENT with communication - very much appreciated for two frazzled parents traveling with a 1 year old and a 4 year old during corona-craziness.  The beach is about 150 yards away. restaurants within walking distance. supermarkets and other need-to-have a 5-7 minute drive away.Grill on site. everything you need and CLEAN.  Our boys went crazy and I got to walk a beautiful beach with my four year old every day for a week while he wondered at the palm trees. iguanas. boats and other children speaking different languages.  Highly recommended.

25743456,Nicole,February,2020,"Juan's well equipped/clean and spacious duplex  townhouse is perfect for those who want to be able to walk to the beach and to many local favorites.  The neighbors are friendly and the complex is safe and quiet. The view is  very nice. Two balconies and lovely large patio facing the ocean for morning coffee or dinner . You do see the parking lot to the beach (only has cars in the day)  But it was lovely just the same and not as loud as youd think . The house is well equipped and it's close to other nearby beaches and Resturaunts . It's a great home base to spend for short or long stays. Bed are comfortable. House is clean. Kitchen has everything you need. Juan was a gracious host leaving cold beer and Coqui liquor to ""get the party started "".   Be sure to go to art walk and live salsa night on Thursday in the middle of town and gylro.  Take the car and  Eat authentic at rincon boriqua on 115 (we've eaten mofongo and chuletta kan kan just about everywhere  and this is where you need to eat!) They also have pastelles (Tamales Puerto rican style)  . We also enjoyed a ride to anasco to Kaplash for empanadas (ask for the home made pike. You can buy some too!) Go to gonzolandia falls in san sebastian.  Go to el bahio in joyuda/cabo roja . Locally spend time in calmer sandier beaches (Dona lala ) or on stretches of beaches in the stella area near confressi and rincon of seas. Theres alot to do right by the townhouse ( rockier beach. But very scenic . I suggest you walk slightly left to get yourself a slice of heaven in less crowded area. ) . If you walk a bit further your connected to a sandier  beach as well . So be brave and explore ! Puerto rico/west coast rincon  has so much to see! Including the  laid back/barrio surfing culture in  Rincon. The people are warm and welcoming everywhere on this coast. OH! and you MUST get some pastries at rinconimi :) guava and queso! Que Rico!! . Estela was a very nice treat too! And of course ..all the other local favorites like pools sushi. Etc. Buen provecho and enjoy Juan's beautiful home while you enjoy all that west coast Puerto rico has to offer. His place is a great place to enjoy it easily. Thank you Juan!!Show more"

547668160864688133,Laura,March,2022,Thanks for the last minute stay! The place had everything we needed and was right by the beach and coffee and a general store. It was a perfect stop!!
547668160864688133,Nicole,March,2022,I know Daniel's place doesn't have a bunch of reviews. but don't let that steer you away because everything was perfect! place is right across from the beach. the bar across the street has some good food and drinks. and there are a couple of little outdoor food places minutes walk down the road. Daniel made recommendations on food. and even gave us some beach chairs to use during our stay for no cost! he's super hospitable as well as his cleaning staff. stay at punta taino guesthouse! :)

45516726,Waleska,May,2022,Nice and clean place to stay with a good location with quick access to restaurants and downtown Rincon.
45516726,Waleska,March,2022,Great location
45516726,Ron,March,2022,Excellent directions. less than a mile outside Rincon center.  Good value. nice to hear rain on a tin roof.  Very clean.  Roku TV turns on every time you turn the a/c on or off. but a/c was excellent.  Nothing like it after a day at the beach.
45516726,Hector,February,2022,Excellent location. walking distance to the beach (10min). Nice and clean. great friendly host!!!!

45516726,Margo,February,2022,Small clean living space. Quiet lot of land. Nice and attentive hosts. 10 minute walk to main road. walk to Marina in 35-40 minutes. If you have a car there is plenty of parking. At the time no WiFi but my cell service worked great at the home..I will stay at Michele‚Äôs next visit.

45516726,,MayraSeptember,2021,excellent location. cozy. horrible bed. bad pillows. It its what it is!
45516726,Ashlee,September,2021,The place was very clean and included all essential amenities like soap. towels. coffee and a TV. It is a small space but perfect if you are exploring all day and just need a place to lay your head. About a 15 minute walk to the beach and just a few minutes driving distance to a handful of gorgeous beaches. The neighborhood is totally safe and easy to navigate! I will say I wish there were an area to sit outside of the room such as the picnic table pictures but besides that. everything was as described!
45516726,Valeria,July,2021,Great place. super cozy and great location!

45516726,Response from Michele,February,2021,Thank you for your review.  However. it is a ‚Äúwalkable‚Äù distance to the beach. The photos are accurate. However the space may have seemed smaller when you brought a third person to stay the night without notice when the listing clearly says it‚Äôs for a maximum of two guests. I do believe an extra mattress in the room takes up extra space.Show more
45516726,Shanda,February,2021,Great stay. clean and very budget friendly and close to beach and restaurants. The host was great and it was some nice special touches upon arrival. Only downside was that I woke up with a frog in my face. so it‚Äôs very close to nature .

23162752,Rebecca,November,2022,The terrace was awesome. We spent hours up there. almost the whole night. Very comfortable space. and Floralis is such an awesome host in every way.Warning: map apps and texting are super unreliable over most of Puerto Rico. Dropped pins and actual phone calls are the more reliable options here. Listen to your hosts carefully on these matters and you will have an easier time than we did.
23162752,Brett,September,2022,Great place to crash in Puntas. great rooftop deck and location for all the best beaches Puerto Rico has to offer.

AC. warm showers. all the channels for when you want to chill at home after a day at the beach. breathe giving views from the roof top where you can watch the sunrise and sunset while the birds sing sweetly all day long.

23162752,Charity,July,2021,We had a great stay at the Terrace apartment - having an air conditioner in the bedroom was great. beautiful views of the stars form the terrace. and it was nice to e able to get away from the more crowded downtown.  Jennifer's personal folder of favorite places also helped us choose what to experience.  We loved that this was in easy driving of so many beaches!  We were sent a dropped pin and details of the location. which made the apartment easy to find despite more remote.   An additional outdoor shower and sink also helped us not to drag sand everywhere.

Reserved parking space which is also great. We had a busy schedule so we didn‚Äôt get to use to rooftop but I went up to check it out and it is lovely. I imagined it would be great for spending some relaxing time enjoying the amazing view. I would definitely consider it again if I come back to Rincon.

23162752,Sebasti√°n,October,2020,Jennifer's place is well located in Rinc√≥n and is a comfortable apartment with all the amenities you need for a short stay. The best part of the apartment is the rooftop with hammocks and rocking chairs - great views of the Rincon and Aguadilla bays. plus stars and the surrounding landscapes!

23162752,Jasmine,June,2020,The perfect place if you‚Äôre looking for a low cost trip to Rinc√≥n. This was a basic place with just what you need. The highlight of the place is definitely the terrace it has amazing views during the day of the jungle and is a perfect place to watch stars at night. Don‚Äôt expect too much in the form of extra frills and you will be happy. The terrace was amazing and the location was really cool.
23162752,Ivan,June,2020,Beautiful view. good location. Decent place. but don‚Äôt expect any luxury. Rooftop needs some work.

23162752,Michelle,February,2019,Our stay was better then we could have ever expected! Our host was available if had questions or concerns. The location was right up the street from the beach and the nightlife. We enjoyed every bit of our stay and believe it was better because of where we stayed.

23162752,Maria,February,2019,Great value for the dollar! Floralis was clean with amazing views. The convenience to the the best beaches around Rincon is outstanding! We loved the Thurs eve art expo in downtown Rincon and highly recommend Cafe 413 downtown. üòÅ
23162752,Bob,January,2019,Great 2nd floor apartment. Plenty of space inside for two people. Very nice outdoor space with hammock and rooftop deck with ocean views all around.

The apartment is quite simple and outdated. We didn't have wifi. which made it a little difficult for us. but at the same time it was fine because it helped us disconnect those days.

50148611,Nikolas,December,2022,Logan was extremely responsive. and accommodating. We were able to check-in outside of the expected hours. The place was clean. as depicted. and had great AC. The location of the place is in an awesome spot with walkable beaches. restaurants. and bars very close by.I‚Äôd highly recommend staying at Logan‚Äôs place if you are visiting the area and want to enjoy the beaches and near by areas.I did have to work during part of my stay and though the wifi was advertised as passively. I found it was great and was able to hop on zoom calls.
50148611,Allison,August,2022,This is a great location. very cute Airbnb. We had a little trouble regulating the humidity levels in the space. but I think that‚Äôs something you just figure out over time. You‚Äôre on an island in the rainforest. it‚Äôs going to get humid. The space has everything you need and is walking distance from beaches and restaurants in Puntas and a short drive to downtown Rincon
50148611,Dali,July,2022,This is the place to relax and recharge. Communication with host was excellent. Check in and out was smooth. Very friendly people who work at the property welcomed us and made sure we didn‚Äôt need anything. I will only recommend a screen door on the apt. so you can enjoy some sun light and the nature that surrouds this beautiful place.We will hopefully stay again soon.Thank you
50148611,Egidio,May,2022,expect quiet time.

50148611,Neysa,March,2022,Wonderful location! Steps from the beach. yoga. shops. ocean front restaurants etc. Comfy and it has everything you need for a beach vacay :)
50148611,Mary Beth,February,2022,Great location. no frills type of place! We were in the bottom unit which didn't have as much natural light but had exactly what we needed. Enough space for two of us. awesome location just a short walk to Sandy or Pools beach and nearby restaurants. Bed was super comfy and had full refrigerator and stove for cooking. Loved being able to come back from the beach and relax at the pool! Logan was quick to respond to questions. Would definitely stay here again!
50148611,Sal,February,2022,Cute studio unit in a great location in Puntas. Steps from the beach and Tamboo restaurant. Casa Verde bar. Jake's Java cafe...Hosts are also very responsive and helpful. I'll be staying here again and recommend to all my friends!
50148611,Steve,February,2022,The bottom floor of Motel Rincon is perfect for short stays for a single person or couple. It stays cool and shaded during the day without A/C and is very comfortable at night. Would definitely stay here again.
50148611,Elvin,January,2022,GREAT Location
50148611,Gregg,December,2021,Nice place and very convenient location! Two minor things: the outdoor shower didn't seem to have any way of controlling the temperature (only the pressure) and there's magnetic curtains/mesh inside the door which would have been cool to use while having the door open. but they were broke part of the way up.
50148611,Gibran,November,2021,Logan He was very aware of everything. the place. the vibe is spectacular .... I'll be back soon!
50148611,Cody And,November,2021,Asssome place right where you want to be!
50148611,Jorge,November,2021,Great location and vibes! Loved the pool area!!
50148611,Elizabeth,September,2021,We recently stayed for two nights and loved it.  Super cute pool area.  We stayed in the efficiency apartment and it was plenty of room for two people.  Great location to walk to a few restaurants and beaches. but a quick drive to other beaches and restaurants.
50148611,Sarah,August,2021,This is a lovely place overall. and the host is very accommodating. unfortunately we had several issues. light/ stove/ wifi not working. We were warned about the wifi. though it was still very frustrating. but the rest seemed slightly inconvenient (the stove more so than anything). Parking here takes some Practice. specially for those who are more comfortable with flat easy to park locations. The place also has washer dryers. pool and very close to Sandys beach which was great. The amenities and extra towels were appreciated.
50148611,Lim,August,2021,This place was great. the location was near the beach and other places of interests. The apartment was well equipped and comfortable. The commumication with the hosts was fluent.However. our overall review is based that we were asked to check out earlier because a host booking mistake with other guests (our reservation had still three remaining nights). After replying no to the  first message. they insisted by message and phonecall on us to check out. They offered a refund. a credit and even to look for another place in Rinc√≥n to stay. instead of offering these or other alternatives to the guest that werent check in yet. To the accomodation industry standards. it is a bad business practice in asking people to check out earlier even more so insisting after a negative response the first time.
50148611,Juan F.,July,2021,Motel Rinc√≥n is a great place to stay if you‚Äôre looking for a fun and relaxing getaway in Rincon. The place is tidy. the location is great.  and amenities are top notch. We‚Äôll definitely be back!
50148611,Kara,July,2021,We enjoyed our stay in Rinc√≥n. The place was close to the beach and a few restaurants. The shower worked well and the bed was comfortable. The pool was fixed on our second day so we were able to use it. We appreciated the beach chairs that we were able to borrow. Internet didn‚Äôt work at all until we found a wifi extender in a random cabinet on our last day. We wished there had been blinds on all the windows. particularly in the bathroom.
50148611,Laura,July,2021,Place as described. A block from the beach. Place was quiet. Minimal bugs. Just wish it was cleaned a bit better ( dirt  and dead bugs under the bed and in cabinets)
50148611,H√©ctor D.,July,2021,Logan's place is well located. Just only two minutes walking distance from the beach.
50148611,Denise,July,2021,Awesome cute villa. Near the beach and restaurants. Fully equipped kitchen and nice pool. Peaceful and love the coquis at night. Can‚Äôt wait to return
50148611,Justin,July,2021,Great location. exactly as advertised. great space
50148611,Response from Logan,June,2021,Thanks for staying with Myah.  As we explain when anyone makes a reservation that Rincon is very rural and basically in the jungle. which means bugs.  And as we informed you. the pool is cleaned twice a week by a professional cleaning service.  Rincon isn't for everyone. but we hope you enjoyed visiting the island.Show more
50148611,Dimitri,June,2021,Excellent location right near the beach with easy access to Rincon. Would definitely recommend.
50148611,Basti,June,2021,Nice Location üëå walking distance to the ocean. Logan also send us all information that we needed for the stay.Great Host
50148611,Jessica,June,2021,This place is amazing if you‚Äôre just looking to go to the beach and not use the pool. I was a bit disappointed upon our arrival because when we got there the first thing we wanted to do was get in the pool. Unfortunately.  we couldn‚Äôt get in because the pool was green. I grew up in Puerto Rico and understand the bug life etc and to be honest that didn‚Äôt bother me. however the fact that the pool was green gave me a bit of concern. The whole reason I booked this room was because of the advertised pool. I said cool. maybe pool maintenance just needs to come to shock pool. I reached out to owner about the pool and he assured the pool ppl would come the following day Monday to clean the pool. He mentioned they stop 2 times a week to clean the pool. Monday and Thursday. I was super excited knowing they would come the following day. Owner gave me the whole speach about we are in the jungle. bugs etc for me to keep that in mind. However. no bugs were in the pool at the time of my arrival. The water was just green. Monday afternoon comes and still no one showed up to clean the pool. I reached out to Logan about the situation and espressed my concern. He basically was kinda rude about it and made it seem like I was the impatient one. Literally said he couldn‚Äôt snap his fingers for pool maintenance to come after he guaranteed they would come the following day. We went back and forth about the matter and to be honest got no where. They never came on Monday. Tuesday was my check out day and he said they would be coming. We left without using the pool because no one ever came to clean it. I‚Äôve never had issues before like this with a host. It was kinda weird to me actually. Even the cleaning lady was concerned about that green pool. Shoot I even offered to vacuum the pool on my own. Moral of the story don‚Äôt let Logan feed your head into thinking its ok for you to get in a green dirty pool because his pool ppl tell him it‚Äôs safe. Don‚Äôt let Logan feed you the whole ‚Äúpuerto rico is not for everyone because of it‚Äôs wildlife. bugs etc‚Äù theres no reason for that pool to look like that when it‚Äôs advertised crystal blueShow more
50148611,Charity,June,2021,Loved our stay! This spot has a very cool. beach villa vibe. Walkable to the beach and some great restaurants and a coffee shop. Logan was so helpful and quick to respond. Would absolutely recommend and would stay again in a heartbeat!

50148611,Shakil,July,2021,Location: The pin sent us to the building next door. which was very similar. We tried calling the host and they never answered. We were able to identify the place because of the color of the windows. Pool: It was relaxing and pleasant. It had a bluish and greenish color. but we understand that it was due to the high concentration of Clorox. PS: If you have space to make a BBQ. keep in mind that you need charcoal. Apartment: The apartment as such is very modern and nicely decorated. Areas for Improvement: When we arrived at the apartment. we had to sweep the floor because it was not very clean and we could feel the sand while walking barefoot. The apartment (first floor) has many transparent windows without curtains (except one that covers absolutely nothing) that give for the bed. bathroom and furniture. For us this was very alarming because you could literally see everything from the outside and we considered that this was an invasion of the privacy that we were looking for. Eventually we had to cover all the windows with towels. wipes and other things we found in the apartment. If our observations are taken into consideration. we would return to Motel Rincon. Our experience wasn't bad. so I give it a 7/10.Location: The pin location sent us to the building next door which is super similar. Tried to contact the host via phone call but never answered.

574050299494691872,Vianca,December,2022,Lisa is friendly and responded to my questions super fast. The place was so clean. so organized and very pretty. The surroundings were peaceful and calm. I read a review saying dogs barked all night but that was not the case for me. I heard a neighbor‚Äôs dog barking for a second during the day but that‚Äôs what dogs do. There was no loud music. no loud cars no loud nothing! I loved it and I recommend 100%

The neighborhood gives the true authentic PR experience. this is no sterile hotel for your typical tourist! Horses. chickens and iguanas right outside the windows and doors at all times. and still just a 5 minute car right to the beach. the supermarket. and even less to the plaza! I would stay here again in a minute. and in fact I most likely create an opportunity to do so. Lisa is a true gem of a host!
574050299494691872,Kahlil,July,2022,Very calmed and quiet place. Clean and close to main areas in Rincon
574050299494691872,Chen-Yin,June,2022,We had a nice stay at Lisa‚Äôs place.  It is spacious and clean.  Shower works great!
574050299494691872,Jay,June,2022,A wonderful. cozy place a short walk from the town center and beach. Very secluded and peaceful!
574050299494691872,Renee,June,2022,Lisa‚Äôs place is conveniently located to many Rincon restaurants and the beach. Spacious bedroom and clean home. We appreciated having a dedicated parking spot. As another reviewer mentioned. there are animal noises but that is to be expected from the area and can even be charming to hear.
574050299494691872,Jennifer,May,2022,Lisa‚Äôs place is the perfect location for visitors wanting to experience the city. beach. and country. It‚Äôs located in the nearby neighborhood but due to the acreage and trees. there are beautiful bird and frog sounds at night and horses and chickens in the day. (And of course the neighborhood dogs.) You‚Äôll also see iguanas and the walking birds in the driveway routinely. It was an amazing introduction to rincon. And Lisa is always available for questions and supplies.
574050299494691872,Joseph,April,2022,Lisa is very quick to response and always available for all your needs! Place is super clean and is near the plaza. super good! And check in is super easy! Highly recommended!
574050299494691872,Andre,April,2022,5 star. Comfortable and convenient.  I HIGHLY recommend this apartment.
574050299494691872,Katy,March,2022,Lovely place with a lot of space! It‚Äôs within walking distance to the main road with lots of restaurants and about a 15-20 min walk to a beach.-They provide one beach towel in the closet if you need it. -Shampoo and conditioner provided.-Bed was decent! Slight harder than I‚Äôm used to but not uncomfortable.-Bring some ear plugs if noise is an issue for you because there are roosters and a few dogs nearby that wake up early! You will get this probably anywhere you stay in Rincon though.
574050299494691872,Jessica,March,2022,Great host and location! Clean. close to town. very comfortable. highly recommend!
574050299494691872,Reuben,March,2022,Perfect host! She was extremely great and accommodating! Place is great and very clean and functional. Kitchen is tiny but very functional. I would recommend!

48538872,Laura,April,2022,Amazing property.  We vacationed there with our 4 kids and swam in the pool every day.  The location is very convenient and beautiful.  It‚Äôs high on the hill so you can see the ocean from various points.  We had everything we needed!
48538872,Julian,March,2022,John was super responsive and helpful with getting settled. Views are amazing. Quick drive to the city center and beautiful beaches. Being someone who's spent time living on the island in San Juan and Cayey. I couldn't have hoped for a better place to stay with 4 friends while seeing Rincon for the first time. Appreciate you John!
48538872,Chelsea,February,2022,What can I say. this place was the perfect way to spend our time as a group in Rincon. The pool and the view from that area (especially at sunset) was breathtaking. the porch area is perfect for a morning coffee or an afternoon nap. Very clean and well maintained space. secure and felt very safe the whole time. We have already recommended this air bnb to a number of friends going to PR in the near future. Thanks John!
48538872,Ruby,January,2022,We had an outstanding time at this fantastic home.  it was everything we wanted and more.  I can not wait to return.  We are beyond pleased.

48538872,Jp,November,2021,My wife and I. with our 3 kids. go away somewhere new for Thanksgiving every year.  We are so glad we picked Rincon and John‚Äôs place.  Home is on top of the hill. surrounded by 11 acres of forest. with the ocean in the back drop.  Possibly best view in Rincon!  Beautiful home. infinity pool was amazing. plenty of space for 5 people‚Ä¶.and John answered all of our questions quickly.  Price was great as well for this getaway.   Very quiet for privacy. but very close to EVERYTHING!  We left our personalized magnet on the mini fridge to solidify our stay! Thank you!
48538872,Ruby,November,2021,This home is a win win... if you can afford it just book it! You will not be disappointed.  It was completely out of my budget but I decided to splurge on lodging and I have no regrets!  This home is spacious. beautifully decorated. has spectacular views. nicely furnished and has air conditioning üëå throughout the entire home. I slept in the master bedroom and the bed and linen where so wonderful.  The king size bed was soooo comfy and linen was soft.  (high-quality). felt devine against my skin.  John responds quickly and is  very thoughtful host.  I highly recommend.  Don't hesitate just book it!
48538872,Alexander,October,2021,An excellent experience!  The interior of the house is super comfortable. everything completely clean and organized.  Very nice outdoor area with a pool and a spectacular ocean view!  John was very kind and always answered our questions with priority!  Unquestionably we return!

48538872,Luzmary,September,2021,This place is awesome. Close to the Plaza. beach and popular restaurant. The view is beautiful. All the amenities of the house and the pool were what we needed and more. Everything about this house is perfect. Couldn‚Äôt ask for more. Definitely coming back.
48538872,Jen,August,2021,Wow!! What a spectacular home! Clean. comfortable and views for days. Location cannot be beat - just minutes from the center of town and very easy to find. We really appreciated the quality of furnishings & bedding. John  was an excellent communicator and made sure we could reach him if there were any issues (there were NONE). Great place for a family to enjoy quality time together without being cramped. Definitely on our favorites list!

18191935,Liam,May,2022,Fantastic location 2-3 minutes walk from the beach. We loved having a morning walk on the beach and a swim before starting our day. Definitely need a car to enjoy Rincon.
18191935,Response from Pablo,March,2022,Thanks for your remarks. We'll take measures to ensure these items are taken care of. Regarding communication I did reply  through text message immediately after you contacted us. after check-in. Something might have prevented you from receiving my replies.Show more
18191935,Maggie,December,2021,Great location Very nice apartment Has everything that is neededWould definitely rent againPablo was very responsive and friendly
18191935,Anna,November,2021,My family and I very much enjoyed our stay at the condo. The location is the BEST in Rincon - close to the town. amenities (dining. supermarket. bakeries. sports complex. shopping. day trips) and beaches galore!  With proximity comes the noise of Hwy 115 day and night. The condo will meet all of your basic needs. The appliances need to be replaced. and the furniture and bedding need a refresh. During our stay. the AC in the living room was not working. but I understand that this is being looked into. Overall. it is a comfortable place to call home for a short while.
18191935,Nelsa,June,2021,This apartment is located in probably the best beach area for people who love the beach but are not surfers.  It is a wonderful neighborhood close to everything.  I loved having my morning coffee sitting in the balcony.  No sea view but a nice neighborhood one block from the beach.  If you book make sure they guarantee the a/c in the second room is working.  You will love your stay in Rinc√≥n which is a paradise.
18191935,Annette,May,2021,Great place and location. Host was very responsive to our questions and needs. Will surely return.
18191935,Bianca,May,2021,The apartment has marvelous potential & an ideal location. Some upkeep/upgrades are needed but you're sure to have a comfy & accessible stay.
18191935,Charles,March,2021,Could spot. Great for being close to the surf and having a full kitchen. ACs worked as did the internet. Pablo was helpful and responded if ever had a question.
18191935,Leah,February,2021,The location of Pablo‚Äôs condo was perfect! It was just down the street from a nice public beach. Walking distance to tons of restaurants and even a food truck park. It has 2 patios with a nice view.
18191935,Brenda,July,2020,Had a great time with family!
18191935,Holly,March,2020,This is a nice. airy apartment in a great location. 1 block to a very nice swimming beach and about a 10-15 minute walk to town. Super convenient to everything in Rincon!
18191935,Response from Pablo,January,2020,Juan and his family stayed at our place for New Year‚Äôs eve weekend. Communication was open and effective. Based on our conversation. they enjoyed their stay. As he stated. there were a couple minor setbacks with appliances. but we were able to solve them within a day.  I‚Äôm glad they had a good time in PR for the holidays and i look forward to hosting them again in the future.Show more

I was with my family and they were very comfortable. the apartment was very spacious. The location was spot on for our needs and weekend activities.
18191935,Laura,April,2018,Pablo‚Äôs place is a great space. with modern decor. and a fresh relaxing vibe!!!! It is equipped with everything you need for a relaxing weekend or a vacation with your family. Space was very clean. it was very easy to find and has a great rooftop where you can relax and enjoy the breeze and do some bbq or just lounge and take in the sun!!! Pablo was waiting for us with the keys and share with us a couple of places to eat and hangout and some very useful tips. It is walking distance to a small beach that use to be much bigger and had more space of sand before the hurricane but it‚Äôs still very nice and has some sand for you to pass some time there. if that is not for you it is only a very short drive away from Rinc√≥n‚Äôs most popular beaches. The local supermarket and it‚Äôs just a block away in a small shopping plaza where you can also find beach supplies. and some other stuff! Very convenient!!!The bed at the master bedroom was suuuper comfy!!! I slept like a baby!!! It was great!!!! It was very nice!!!! I loved it and will definitely go back!!!

47846886,Jessica,July,2021,definitely use the Bahn Ploong Thai Restaurant on Google maps or waze to find the house. no exact address.  a little confusing. The house has more of a mainland country vibe. you can't miss it. Quiet neighborhood. close to many beaches and a quick drive into town.  We loved the local panader√≠a Ricomini! Also Marco's pizza. was great!
47846886,Eulisa,July,2021,Comfortable and spacious house with everything we needed for a wonderful beach weekend.
47846886,Yolanda,June,2021,The house was nice and cozy - very clean. The beds were super comfortable - they house had beach chairs and small cooler we were able to use which was so convenient.  My only complaint is there is no house # provided for accuracy when using GPS but once we reached out to David he directed us to where the house is located which was a few houses back.   Would definitely come back.
47846886,Will,May,2021,Awesome place. House was even better than advertised. 10 minute walk down a relatively quiet residential street to Sandy Beach. A handful of good restaurants/bars within walking distance. Short drive to town of Rincon and other beaches.

20355088,Leif,November,2021,The house is probably even better than the pictures. the views are amazing. and location is perfect - within 10 minutes drive of most beaches and restaurants in Rincon. We didn‚Äôt need ac at all. the sea breeze at night kept everything cool. Easy booking. check in/check out. and responsive host - we asked about snorkeling gear and some was dropped off the next morning. Would recommend without hesitation. and I‚Äôll be staying here again if I come back to Rincon with some friends.
20355088,Giovani,August,2021,everything was perfect and attention when we need help was perfect honestly i got my location for the next trip to puerto rico and definitely i recommend this place to my friends

20355088,Brenda,April,2021,This is a gorgeous house. totally equipped with anything you might need.  Very spacious so our family felt like they all had their own private space.  The view to die for and perfect for to enjoy a cup a coffee in the mornings and a glass of wine in the afternoon.  If you are considering this house don't think about it twice.  Be aware that this is a stylish place which need to be cared for even by guests..  My only recommendation is that if want to sleep in. bring an eye mask since there are no blackouts in the windows.  However. don't let that stop you from staying in Casa Kahunna.  You won't regret it.
20355088,Pauline,March,2021,A truly lovely location. with a breeze cooling off from the PR heat and a quick drive to most locations. And the onsite team is amazing!  I texted to ask if by chance there were yoga mats in the house and got an answer within minutes and mats brought over from another house early the next morning!
20355088,Ernesto,March,2021,Spectacular property in the best area of Rincon.  The villa has everything you need and more. the neighborhood is peaceful and just a hop away from everything.You don‚Äôt need to bring anything the house has everything you need.Counting the days to be back.
20355088,Paula,March,2021,Thank you! AMAZING
20355088,Guillermo,February,2021,Awesome place with amazing views.
20355088,Response from Rochelle,February,2021,I'm sorry if you feel I was unfriendly. but you treated the house like a fraternity for two weeks and I had to come to the house three times for noise complaints late at night.  I didn't want to completely bash you for your immature behavior but now I feel like I should warn other property owners.  You stained the carpet. broke the solid wood cutting board. bled on the sheets and mattress pad which had to be thrown out. left dirty condoms in the bedroom and somehow my vacuum cleaner went missing which you claim you know nothing about.    I am paid to be a property manager. not a baby sitter.  Next time you rent someone's home please be more respectful.Show more
20355088,Mara S.,January,2021,Breathtaking view. literally! Super clean and stylish. Great for a weekend getaway with your best friends or close family. If you're planning to cook in. I suggest you do so. It has everything you need for the kitchen and a rectangular table that fits about 10+ guests overlooking the ocean. Pool temperature was on point. Good parking space and great location! Host was super responsive and attentive.

Our family had an amazing time.  Were extremely comfortable with the accommodations.  We will love to return for a longer period of time.  Simply loved it.
20355088,Jessenia,August,2020,Casa Kahuna is awesome! It was my 3rd time staying at the house and it never disappoint. We went during COVID-19 time. lot of beaches were closed so we really enjoyed staying in the house using the pool! Amazing views all day long and nice quiet nights. Just the relaxing vacation we were looking for. The house provide most of the amenities you need so no need to go outside! Allison were super helpful as always. Highly recommended!
20355088,Lizbeth,August,2020,Casa Kahuna is an amazing. modern and peaceful propety with great views of Rincon.  The property is spacious and well equipped with everything you need and more.  I highly recommend this property for a group of friends and/or families with small children.  My 5-year old nephew and niece definitely enjoyed their time on the pool.  We'll come back again!!!

20355088,Gabriel,May,2020,Amazing place and host.
20355088,Sonia L.,May,2020,Everything was perfect!
20355088,Daisy,March,2020,Our stay at Casa Kahuna was amazing! From drinking coffee on the balcony overlooking the ocean (the view is out of this world!)  to the cute swimming pool to the closeness to the beaches! It was wonderful :)  We will be back!
20355088,Gabriella,January,2020,Casa Kahuna was absolutely the best Airbnb my family and I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. From every detail that was thought of throughout the home: sonos speakers. beach chairs and towels. shower supplies. a fully supplied kitchen. clean salt water pool. bbq grill. easy check in etc. I could go on and on. Waking up every morning to the sunrise over the ocean view was stunning. We didn't even need the AC at night because the ocean breeze was so nice coming through the windows.  This house has everything you need in order to fully enjoy your vacation. if you are staying in to BBQ and enjoy the pool or if you are headed to the beach for the day all supplies were provided. It was not a problem driving to the beach each day as everything is only a 5 min drive into town. The house provided a book of all the things you could need in order to enjoy your vacation as if you lived there. I can not thank Rochelle and Allison enough for sharing their home with my family!!
20355088,Brenda,December,2019,Pro‚Äôs: Nice. clean with the best view in Rinc√≥n. Tastefully decorated. Space is airy and sun comes from every place! Kids loved the place. Pool instructions were confusing. A little annoyed with maintenance people showing up for two hours as we were to dip in the pool. Talked to owner and manager and suggested to include a little note in reservation/booking site. Very satisfied with their prompt response.
20355088,David,December,2019,Rochelle‚Äôs house is beautiful. clean. and modern. We loved our stay! Views from the balcony and the pool are to die for. Great place for a larger group as there is plenty of sleeping space. We would definitely stay here again.
20355088,Vanessa,October,2019,This home is beautiful and made to appreciate the beauty that Puerto Rico is. The home is very comfortable and stylish suitable for a group of friends and families. The home close to many beautiful beaches and attractions. Would definitely stay here again the next time.
20355088,Todd,October,2019,Casa Kahuna is amazing. If you're hanging out in Rincon. I can't imagine a better value for the money!
20355088,Devaliss,October,2019,We were a group of 8 people including kids and were very comfortable. The house is large and comfortable. good view. the pool is good. the kitchen is equipped. A/C in bedrooms. washer and dryer (the door handle is broken).  internet. Sonos system and is  located in rural and quiet area.  We only have two recommendations: first;  that the bedrooms need blackout in the windows. THIS IS A MUST.  The sun comes in through the window from 6 am and you literally can't rest until late. The first night we went to bed super late and didn't rest at all. The second recommendation is that the common areas need more ventilation. there is no A/C in kitchen. family. etc and in this month (September) the weather is very hot. so we have difficulties staying inside when there was no breeze.  But overall it was a good stay. The house is astounding. Thanks.
20355088,Vanessa,October,2019,Amazing home with breath-taking views.Casa Kahuna is a jewel in Rincon and her host Rochelle does a great job taking care of you while you are there.The house is strategically located at a hill with a clear view of the mountains and the water. Every morning you had the beautiful sounds of nature wake you up to an amazing sunrise right outside the window. You can walk out on the terrace and enjoy the beautiful view while taking a sip out of your coffee or reading a book alongside the pool. Rooms were very private and the house is very spacious. It can accommodate a large group without feeling crowded. Crisp and clear speaker system all around the house to always have the perfect mood. Fully equipped kitchen and BBQ allows to plan breakfast/brunches/dinners in-house. Also. 2nd floor balcony faces the beautiful view and everyone can sit together and eat. Pool water was always perfect. never too warm or cold. We were always in. no matter the time of day. You will not regret your stay here. Attention to detail was amazing. It far exceeded our expectations.Show more
20355088,Mara,August,2019,Awesome house. great views
20355088,Penny,July,2019,We had a difficult time rating this home. The views. house and saline pool were spectacular. The number of bedrooms and bathrooms. fully stocked kitchen. A/C in bedrooms. internet TVs. Sonos sound system and decks were great. Allison was also accommodating. allowing us to enter early when the housekeepers were done. So for all of these. they would get 5 stars.However. the lack of A/C in the  common areas prohibited us from cooking dinners in the  kitchen or playing games at night when there was no breeze. We understand that there are normally tradewinds and probably 10 months out of the year it is cooler. Even worse than the heat in the house. EVERY morning at 6am there were workers hammering. scraping. talking and using a front loader right next to the house as they were working on the pool and driveway at the new house next door! To be awakened every morning to it and then not even being able to enjoy the quiet beauty while drinking one cup of coffee on the balcony. made us a little irritable (ok. made me a raging wench as coffee+quiet=life.) My husband even posted on FB one morning with a video of it!  We understand the workers are trying to beat the heat and Rochelle & Allison probably had no control over it but it stopped us from getting the peace and rest we deserved. These two things added up would get 2 stars at best.  So we landed at 3.5 and rounded up to 4 stars. The house is astounding. the construction next door is temporary. and in cooler months the common areas and kitchen would be fine.Show more
20355088,Denis,July,2019,A beautiful house with everything you‚Äôll ever need inside. So big you can get lost! Very nice pool with a great view. Enjoyed it 200% !!!
20355088,Maria,June,2019,Perfect house for relaxing! Great for families.
20355088,Nereida,June,2019,Casa Kahuna is an amazing home. Perfect for adults and children. It has everything you need for your vacation. We loved the salt water pool. the house speaker system. the fully equipped kitchen. the bedrooms. and that breathtaking view! We would definitely stay here again.
20355088,Oscar,June,2019,Amazing Place. 5 stars
20355088,Antonio,May,2019,The home is spacious. has everything you need. killer pool and killer views! A+ definitely will be back!!!
20355088,Criselda,March,2019,Excellent communication and lovely home. we came to visit family in a mayaguez and everything you could ask for and more in an air BNB.  It fit 8 adults and 1 child perfectly with enough room to spare.
20355088,Maia,February,2019,This is an awesome home and one of the best airbnb experiences I‚Äôve had! We split the house between four guests and we had more than enough space. The location is within 7-8 minutes of some of the best beaches and town via car. but feels very secluded and private. I was pleasantly surprised to find the kitchen had LITERALLY EVERYTHING we needed to cook a proper meal! The pool was perfect for late afternoons after the beach. and the gym was also nice! When I return to Rincon I will definitely try to stay here again.
20355088,Dayana,December,2018,It was great !
20355088,Robyn,October,2018,Serne spot with breathtaking view. away from the hustle&bustle and within miles from English Rose and Breach House üëçüèºüëçüèºwinner. winner!
20355088,Felix,September,2018,The house is great for large groups and has all the amenities you could need. The views are beautiful and the location is about 5 minutes from la plaza de Rincon where you can find restaurants and bars. also there are a lot of other great places and activities to do nearby.Would definitely visit again and as well recommend it.
20355088,Norein,July,2018,This is a great house. perfectly designed and decorated. Has everything you need for an awesome beach vacation getaway. Thanks for sharing your wonderful house. Hope to be back soon!!!
20355088,Lorna,July,2018,After Maria beat up the house we usually rent in Vieques. we opted for Rincon. What a great choice Casa Kahuna was! Impeccably clean. great amenities. close to beaches. and has an awesome salt water pool. There is really nothing that I would change. We were two adults and five kids and had a blast. Looking forward to returning.
20355088,Response from Rochelle,June,2018,Thanks for staying with us!
20355088,Response from Rochelle,June,2018,We're thrilled you had such a memorable time at Casa Kahuna.  We appreciate all your kind words as we worked so hard to make the rental home special for everyone to enjoy. Please come back and visit us again.Show more

20355088,Elimar,June,2020,This accommodation is a beautiful house with excellent amenities. But the host is an aggressive person. during my stay he had to intervene the police on two occasions with her. there is no type of privacy. all simply because it does not allow you to take guests to the house. a rule that is not written in any of the house rules. If you want to spend a few days in peace and enjoy. then unfortunately this is not the alternative. These hosts have multiple properties. and no one should be there to support or visit.  I have all of the evidence and proof of what happened in addition to the police report.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
20355088,Lydianette,June,2020,A cozy place full of spaces and decoration with taste... Clean ... near the village of Rincon.The house has unique views. it is spacious and full of peace! We loved itTranslated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

Discovering this area of Rincon with beautiful views and in a relaxing atmosphere makes you not want to end your stay. The house is even more beautiful than what's presented in the photos. Every room is very comfortable. with good mattress and pillows. Very clean and well-equipped bathrooms with everything you need.

9918605,James,March,2021,Awesome place to stay!
9918605,Matthew,February,2021,Traveling with my wife (a 14 time consecutive Airbnb SuperHost) and our adult daughter. we booked this space for 3 days because the room looked warm & inviting. Unfortunately. the pictures do not represent what the room actually looks like. There are no color blankets. no throw pillows. the room was not bright and airy. Instead we walked into a dark. dingy. dated room. Stark. with stained headboards. no blankets. (although they did leave tiny. one person thin throws). dirty window sills and coffee pot. And while they do advertise a kitchen there was were no utensils. plates. bowls or bottle opener. Three towels for 3 people to stay for 3 days. No wash cloths and one hand towel. Two of the 4 interior lights were not working. so my wife asked the host if she could replace them. She did replace one bulb but advised that she was not able to fix the second one. While waiting for the host to replace the bulbs. my wife and daughter were sitting in the pool area and there was an overwhelming fowl odor. When the host returned my wife asked where the smell was coming from to which the host replied ‚Äúsomething died in the yard and we can‚Äôt locate it.‚Äù She then told my wife and daughter that ‚Äúyou‚Äôre obviously not happy here and I don‚Äôt need guests who don‚Äôt love my place so maybe you should find another place to go.‚Äù We had just driven 2.5 hours from San Juan and really didn‚Äôt want to start looking for another place. however. at this point the host was being quite aggressive in suggesting we go elsewhere and that she would refund our unused nights. After agreeing that we would find another place to stay. the host sent a message threatening to call the police if we were not off her property by 11:30 am. even though we paid for 3 days and had done absolutely nothing wrong. We left the following morning and the host did refund the remaining two nights. As professional people and Airbnb Owners/hosts who take great pride is providing excellent experiences for our guests. this was was the most unprofessional experience we‚Äôve ever encountered.Show more

9918605,Roxie,July,2020,It is a great place to stay with your family or with your couple. Even though the pool/jacuzzi is small is really enjoyable. The room is big and the best part is the hammock in the balcony. I will definitely come back whenever I come to PR again.

9918605,Allan,June,2020,I had a really good experience in my stay. everything was really clean. the host was amazing and friendly also the room amenities were really new and the ac was absolutely amazing also the hot water was incredible. how ever. the pool/jacuzzi area was a bit uncomfortable. I think it'll be nice to maybe divide 1 or 2 specific hours for each room to stay in the pool/jacuzzi area. because due to the virus we can't get close to each other and in all the time I stayed there I couldn't enjoy it (some pool time) because there were people everytime I checked to get inside and they stayed there for tons of time and didn't let others enjoy the facilities. also I didn't see people cleaning the pool area and jacuzzi and some people staying there were starting to get a bit intimate at night which was uncomfortable too... But aside from that. my experience was really amazing and will totally book again some other time.
9918605,Tachie,June,2020,We stay for two nights. The place was amazing and the rooms have everything you need. The common areas where peacefull and the most important they follow the Covid-19 safety protocol. Watching the sunrise and the sunset for our room was magic. Definetly I'll recommended it and will be comming back very soon ‚ô•Ô∏è

9918605,Joanna,March,2019,The place was very nice. we enjoyed our stay. The pool was great and tons of suggestions on what to do. The only thing was we had to buy toilet paper once we ran out of what they provided (2 rolls) or we had to pay $10 for it. But overall the stay was great. beautiful views and clean!
9918605,Gina,January,2019,Lovely hideaway with fantastic views - The private balcony was so perfect we almost wished we could have slept out there!  Walkable to the immediate area of Sandy Beach. but would recommend a rental car as there is nothing for purchase on site. and taxis are hard to come by.

The rooms were super clean and comfortable and the host provided a light breakfast every morning. I'll be back soon!
9918605,Fransheska,January,2016,This was our first Airbnb experience. We are locals but we live in California and we visit Rincon every year. We were looking for a modern and comfortable space with beach proximity. This is exactly what we got and more! We were blown away by the views and the fact that we could also see green around us not just the beach. We loved the space and the hospitality; we loved the coffee in the morning. We also appreciated the flexibility of check in and check out times. We felt like we were home. It was truly a serene experience! We will make this our #1 choice every year when we come back home.
9918605,Stefan,January,2016,Great stay at Serenity. Sara was helpful and friendly and the location was perfect for us. Be sure to check it out if you're ever in Rinc√≥n!
9918605,Clara,January,2016,We enjoyed our stay at Serenity. The views were lovely and rooms nicely done. Lisa was very easy to contact for information and responds quickly. We did however have a hard time finding this place on the way in. but a local was able to guide us here easily enough. The deep hot tub was also nice and relaxing after a day of strenuous activities.  The early morning coffee and light snacks were also welcoming.

7479940,Barry,January,2017,Igari's place was fantastic! It's just around the corner (less than a block away) from the Plaza in Rincon. There are tons of restaurants there plus an art walk every Thursday. Just an amazing way to be introduced to Rincon. Everything is so close. I was even able to walk down 115 to the local grocery store one day.  The condo itself was also excellent. The condo was nicely furnished and felt very welcoming. The setup was perfect for three people and the kitchen was well stocked. We did have some problems with the wifi. so if you plan to stream Netflix or movies of any sort. be aware of that.  Note that this was true of another place we stayed and may just be a general problem of internet service in Rincon (or Puerto Rico in general). Ignari did a great job communicating and made everything very clear.
7479940,Brandon,November,2016,Great location a block from the main square. Ignari's office is directly below. so she is very quick to respond to almost anything.
7479940,Christinia,October,2016,The neighborhood is beautiful. next to the plaza. The place was easily accessible and clean and nicely decorated.
7479940,Gabriel,March,2016,We spent a marvelous long weekend at Rincon! The apartment is just like the pictures. It is beautifully remodeled and has all you need. It was so nice to walk to the plaza and while parking was on the street we never had a problem in finding a parking spot. The apt has a small backyard with chairs to sit at night and hangout. The bathroom is beautiful! Ignari was a pleasure to talk to and while she was out of town also enjoying the weekend in another close town. it was a breeze locating the apt and getting in. She was available via text at all times. Thank you Ignari! I Would gladly stay there again!
7479940,Phinizy,March,2016,This place is super nice. In a good location for restaurants and not far from the beach although the nightlife is at another part of rincon about 10 minutes away.
7479940,Christopher,February,2016,Everything was perfect about our stay. Ignari has everything so organized we never had to talk with her. though we did run into her walking in town and had a nice chat.  The location was great for strolling in town and walking to the beach was easy. Beds and pillows are very comfortable and air conditioning worked well.  Towels were big thick and fluffy and more than enough for the 3 of us for the week for both the bath and the beach. We cooked a few meals and everything worked well. Tv was fun to watch during the couple of downpours and Internet worked well except Friday night for some reason. Never had to park more than a block away and usually right downstairs. Wish we had another week!
7479940,Response from Ignari,February,2016,Thank you very much for your comment. You and your family are always welcome ;)
7479940,Jakob,January,2016,We had A really Perfect stay at Ignari's in The center of Rincon. The apartment was newly renovated and very Nice and clean. Walking distance to supermarked. Beach and bars! Excellent Experience go go go.
7479940,Zuleika,September,2015,The apartment is amazing! Beautiful and very elegant!! It's located walking distance from a few restaurants and a local brewpub. The owner was very caring and  always reachable. It has really nice beaches and many other good places to eat in a close driving distance. I would gladly stay here again and would recommend it to anyone.
7479940,Manuel,December,2022,Excellent location. the place is very cozy. we coincided with an activity on site and had a wonderful time. the host was very attentive and excellent communication. 100% recommended place!!!Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

7479940,Cristina,January,2017,We were very lucky that Ignari could accept our last minute booking and the truth is that what we encountered upon arrival was great. The location of the apartment was perfect. in a back of the Plaza. so very central to go to any place. even walking to the supermarket (although that's exactly why. at some point it was noisy). The rooms were spacious. with enough good quality towels for both the bathroom and the beach. The apartment itself is very modern and although it does not have specific parking. you can park on the same street or in the back.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
7479940,Winoel,July,2016,We had a brutal Samana weekend celebrating a family member's birthday. everything was as stated on the page. the bathroom. the rooms and everything was very clean. we really liked it and we didn't want to leave. they were in the center of everything...several bakeries. pizzeria. drink shops. beaches and more... all this until walking you arrive. we would definitely come back next summer...Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
7479940,Julien,January,2016,Ignari took care to welcome us as best as possible: beach toys. mid-stay cleaning. bottle of wine..... She even came to visit us quickly to make sure everything went smoothly. The apartment matches the photos and is very nice.  We'll come back if we can. Translated from French¬†¬†Show original
44559432,Paul,August,2022,Wonderful pool. great communication - excellent hosts.
44559432,M√≥nica,July,2022,The outdoor area was very special. Location was minutes from town center. very convenient. We had a great time at Raul‚Äôs property. Thank you.
44559432,Response from Raul,July,2022,Hi Javier! First of all. I thank you for choosing us for your stay in Rinc√≥n. And we thank you for the time that you take to do your very subjective and detailed review.   As we value the time and efforts that our staff put in place to bring the best to our guests. we respect objective and precise reviews that helps us improve our work in the future. Let us clarify some points of your review that we found imprecisely and not quit right. and obviously we disagree.   Your description is perfect when you highlight that our pool is the best area that we have. All guests love it! It‚Äôs just as we show it. and it‚Äôs located around the perfect spot: the nature. our ‚Äúcampo‚Äù. Maybe you didn‚Äôt take the time to review the listing details before rent it. and didn‚Äôt notice that we‚Äôre in a rural area. as we promote. We specifically detail that we‚Äôre located 3-5 minutes‚Äô drive from Rincon‚Äôs beautiful beaches. Obviously not all people are suitable to indulge our paradise. and to stay in a STR. especially the people that loves to stay in a hotel and be served and treat as normally do in those venues.    I‚Äôm sorry that you were upset for the presence of a cat in our premises. In Carmeloria we love animals! Actually. Juliol. our lovely dog. is the real owner of our paradise. a rescued dog that love us every day and is part of what Carmeloria is today. Saying that. and as you mentioned the cat presence. during the past weeks we have had a very particular guest. that appears get in love with Carmeloria. a beautiful cat that has been pet for our guests. even though don‚Äôt belong to us. As you warned us about its presence. we told you that we‚Äôre handling the visitor. looking for good people with a nice home for that little cat. That was the reason that we can‚Äôt fulfill your request when you asked us to take the cat away and abandon in a public and unsafe place. as the lady that spoke to us requested. We‚Äôre so sorry to have the cat. but that kind of surprises occurs in a rural area as you obviously noted where Carmeloria is located. Also. we‚Äôre so sorry that you saw a cat-iguana fight. and that the iguana won jumping into the pool. I think you were so lucky to be part of that nature experience.   Your review about that we don‚Äôt have TV‚Äôs is false. Our 4 full-equipped apartments have a smart TV. each one. The truth is that we don‚Äôt offer offers a TV inside each bedroom. because apartment #1 which have 2 bedrooms. has the TV in the living room.   We read your review a few times. trying to understand what take you down giving us the lowest review that one guests gave us in 3 years of our operations. Maybe you‚Äôre the kind of guests that enjoy more a hotel rather than a STR. We‚Äôll took note of the 2 issues that you mentioned. and repair it ASAP. and we are so sorry for that. maybe if you let us know when you noticed it. we would have taken care in that moment.Show more
44559432,Nelson,June,2022,Excellent place to stay. Very clean and great space to be with the family. The pool area is beautiful and great to spend d the day. Definitely will stay again.
44559432,Paula,May,2022,all perfect
44559432,Amanda,May,2022,This was a great place to stay especially if you have a big party of people. The apartments are gorgeous and modern and supply everything you need - beach or pool. Also super close to the little down town area- restaurants. shops. and the beach. The bedrooms and beds are soooo comfortable. The pool was awesome too. Highly recommend.
44559432,Hilary,May,2022,Wow! Could not have asked for a better host or place to stay. This was my 26th air B and B and hands down my favorite. Raul response time was quick and so friendly. The place was stunning. There were 9 of us and each couple got their own room. like a hotel room with their own key code. bathroom. kitchen and bed. There was gate code to get into the place which made us feel safe and secure. The views and atmosphere where phenomenal. Raul thought of everything from beach towels. beach chairs. bathrooms by the pool and a remote to open the gate. Will definitely stay here again. Highly recommend! Rooms were so cold with the a/c unit in each room and beds were comfy. Thanks for a memorable stay Raul!
44559432,Omar,May,2022,Great
44559432,Sergio,April,2022,The four apartments are great for a big family. Everyone has there on space and everything that you need. Pool is gorgeous.
44559432,Robert,April,2022,We rented the whole property consisting of 4 separate apartments. each with their own keys. beepers. refrigerators & kitchens.  Apartments 2 & 3 can connect if you need them to.  The communal areas are very nice. especially the pool.The cleaning crew did a very good job before we got there & no problem checking in.So we would not be disappointed they made sure to get us a brand new grill before we arrived.  That's great service! We had a great time.
44559432,Melissa,April,2022,Raul's place is wonderful. Lots of space. kitchen equipment and comfortable  king and queen beds (hard to find in PR!). We spent lots of time by the pool. the view of the stars on a clear night is not to be missed. Perfect location as is a quick ride to town and the beach. but secluded and with beautiful property. We will return for sure!
44559432,Annette,March,2022,This property is awesome. I was the with my family and rented all the space. The pool area was so nice that we ended up staying in the pool instead of the beach. It has a BBQ and bathrooms so you can just stay there. All the rooms are extremely comfortable with a fully equipped kitchen. Raul answered very fast to all my questions. We had a great time and will definitely be back in a few month!!!
44559432,Winter,March,2022,This property was gorgeous!! We had a wonderful time. We booked all 4 apartments and had 5 couples with our group. It was the perfect setup. It was nice to have sole access to the property and pool area. Raul was amazing. He was so helpful and very responsive. The rooms were comfortable and the kitchen had everything we needed. We would definitely come back!!
44559432,Christian,March,2022,Carmeloria was a great stay!! It is well located. 3 mins out from downtown Rincon. perfect to explore and enjoy the different restaurants. The apartments are great. comforting and up to date. The facilities overall are a 10/10 from my part. The host is really attentive and quick to respond to any messages. All in all. I definitely recommend it. and would visit again if I ever stay at Rincon again.
44559432,Juan,February,2022,Great place!
44559432,Lisa-Marie,February,2022,everything was great
44559432,Drew,February,2022,Wonderful property for a family vacation. The surroundings were beautiful. serene. quiet. and peaceful. Each casita allowed for private time while having a wonderful outdoor space including the pool and bbq that allowed us to have an extended family poolside bbq and pool time for nieces and nephews. Super easy and quick drive to the grocery store and central Rincon close to restaurants. bars and shops.

44559432,Anabelle,July,2021,I can't say enough about how perfect Casa Carmeloria was for our stay. We rented all 4 apartments and had the place to ourselves and I would highly recommend it. The location is just minutes away from the main road and it made it very easy to drive into town and the beach. The pool was the best place to start and end the day. We will definitely stay at Carmeloria again!
44559432,Juan,July,2021,Can not give this man a better rating but if I could I would . Great communication and explained everything with details. Definitely will be back !
44559432,Morgan,June,2021,I've stayed at many AirBnB's. but this was by far the best experience.  The location was perfect. private but central with access only a few minutes away to Rincon and the beaches.  The pictures don't do Raul's place justice. its nothing short of paradise.
44559432,Javier,May,2021,Great location. It‚Äôs very close to Rincon town square and the beaches yet feels like you are secluded in the mountains. The property is very well maintained. has great amenities and comfortable for large groups. The pool and yard are is great for a swim after a day at the beach.or reading a book on the hammock. Overall. great stay highly recommended for large groups to rent out entire space. Very easy to communicate with Raul!
44559432,Sixto,April,2021,If I could give Raul and Javier an 11 out of 5 stars I would. The check in process was simple and straight forward. We had very high expectations and such were surpassed. The place was impecable. quaint and homie. This listing is a jewel among so many other options. We recommend this place for any experience wether it is a romantic getaway or a family vacation. Raul and Javier went above and beyond when picking out the decor for the place. giving the sensation of peace and tranquility. We will definitely make many more memories in this little piece of paradise.
44559432,Giancarlo,March,2021,Perfect Location! Loved every corner of the property! Super nice pool area. perfect connection with nature. very clean and confortable rooms. ...just perfect! We will definitely come back!!! Thank you Raul!!!
44559432,Emelyn,March,2021,Great place to stay. Very calm and clean. The backyard is homely. The hammock is a great touch. We literally barbecued every day (in a 4 day stay) and everything functioned properly. Breakfast spots near by making the location convenient. The rooms were clean and had great air conditioning. No bugs indoors. Lots of space in every individual apartment. Overall a great space.
44559432,Guillermo,January,2021,Great stay!
44559432,Response from Raul,January,2021,Hector and his family were nice guests. not only because they took care of our 4 apartments. but because they enjoyed # CARMELORIATODA. how we wish everyone who visits us do!See you soon!Show moreTranslated¬†¬†Show original

44559432,Eduardo J,April,2021,Ra√∫l and Javier have been among the best hosts I've ever experienced on Airbnb. Undoubtedly. both the place and the communication with them during the stay made this experience a unique and one to repeat. The facilities were at such an optimal level. given the excellent maintenance of the property (all independent apartments and common areas) that basically there was no need to contact them at all. just to request  an additional grant (a departure at a later time) that they did not hesitate to grant it immediately. The group of 8 was fascinated by the experience. Thank you Ra√∫l and Javier for everything. Highly recommended.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

We truly enjoyed staying here.

Anything needed was provided to us! we were a bit of a large group & although the washer did not work. he took our laundry to the cleaners for us to be cleaned. The city forgot to take out trash and he came to collect it all for us and brought us a gift as well for the inconvenience... He was amazing. the house was beautiful & clean. He also provided the simple amenities that aren't usually included in AIRBNB's. I would highly recommend him as a host & I would definitely stay at his home again. if I am ever traveling to Puerto Rico with a large group :)
48056952,Carlos,June,2021,Brian‚Äôs place is a paradise in Rinc√≥n. with an excellent location and a huge space that allows big families to have an awesome and laidback vacation right in the center of the municipality. The house is huge and has enough parking space for 6-7 cars and has a laundry. pool and BBQ area. Brian built a deck for us to be able to enjoy the pool area even more and did it while it was pouring outside. He also has a basketball hoop. pool table and ping pong tables for guests to turn back the clock and have fun. The beach is 5-10 away and the town‚Äôs heart is really close by too. He is extremely nice and very accommodating. Looking forward to this being our to go house when we visit from the US. üòÅüòÅ

48056952,Kiley,March,2021,We had a wonderful stay at Brian's place. The house is close to the beaches. stores. and restaurants. Some of my favorite things about the house was the comfort and thought behind the amenities- the couch was perfect to fit our large group. the beds were comfortable. and the AC works really well! The doors to the bedrooms cut out any outside noise which is a plus with kids or large groups who may have different schedules. The pool was a huge hit with our kids. Sunrises are amazing to watch off the balcony's with your morning coffee. His kitchen is fully stocked and we had plenty of extras such as towels. cooler. and toilet paper. Brian was extremely quick with response times when we had any questions or any issues and went out of his way to help accommodate us.

50067971,Jonathan,October,2021,The place is very nice and clean. It has all the basics you need in a kitchen and the fridge is large. The air conditioners work üíØ (cold!). The pool is great. but the sun shines all day and so it's warm. It's a good size and ranges from 3ft to 5ft. The apartment is so central. you can walk to the Rincon spa. the public square. and all the restaurants near the plaza. There are supermarkets and gas stations nearby. We had an issue that happened to us and Christian solved an emergency for us. Very good host. We visited several rivers. beaches and tourist places. Everything quite close to the apartment. If you are looking for a central place to be able to do everything that the Rincon area and neighboring villages have. this apartment is ideal. The condo and area is very quiet. No noise during our stay from Wednesday to Monday. The power went out several times but the generator in the active condominium was fast and we didn't lose even 15 seconds every time. If you want a quiet place to rest. this is your place. And if you want to be accessible to many attractions. too!Show moreTranslated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

50067971,Edna,September,2021,The apartment is very nice. accessible and comfortable. It has everything you need to have a hassle-free vacation. The apartment is beachfront but does not have an ocean view. The tbm pool is very small. When we stayed there were 2 TVs but the one in the room didn't work and the one in the living room had no local (PR) shows although if it had US shows and it was a smart TV. As for the surroundings. I recommend going to the spa in front. it is in good condition and the place is nice; there are days where the restaurant or in the building next door is completely closed and the shops around it I think it is Wednesday and plan well. then on Thursdays in the central village there is a kind of night activity in what is the town square. There is like a kind of fair shop and a music orchestra. the other days there is nothing after nine PM. It seems quite quiet. I recommend you also go to the day lighthouse and then to the beaches around for those who like to snorkel or surf. especially this last one is very good in terms of time. It rains a lot. so plan to go to the beach early in the morning and prepare for the rain. Rincon is in a well located village that you can go north or south and take advantage of that and the activities offeredTranslated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

38816854,Jose,August,2022,Beautiful spot ocean front. nice location. Great communication with the manager. Will definitely come back.
38816854,Jo-Annie,July,2022,The location is amazing!! You literally just step outside directly onto the beach. The beach area is very nice and quiet. Enough space to put beach chairs and umbrella. even though you really don‚Äôt need to because the back patio is set up with lounge chairs for any sunbathing. That‚Äôs where we had our morning coffee everyday. The house is simple but nice. cozy and clean. ACs worked great. kitchen was fully equipped and bathrooms were spacious. Will definitely return.
38816854,Robert,June,2022,I want to buy this house!!! This wilL be a house I retire in!!! Amazing
38816854,Oni,June,2022,Mary's pics are exatlt what you will find. very essential home with all you need to have aplace to say after a long day at the beach. the symphony of coquis and the ocean waves cannot be described into words on how therapeutic it. is the neighborhood is so quite and friendly. would definetly come back again and again.
38816854,Victor,May,2022,The house is great! The location is excellent. Everything is as shown in the photos. Direct access to the beach from the patio. The kitchen is well equipped and the arrival/departure was perfect. I would definitely stay again!
38816854,Shawn,April,2022,Fabulous place.  Perfect spot for a surfcation.   Right on great swimming beach.
38816854,Fernando L,April,2022,If you want to stay in a house with a great beach as part of your back yard and with a fabulous view of the sunset every day of your stay. then stay at Casa Mac.I really enjoyed my stay at Mary‚Äôs place and you will too!
38816854,Anna,February,2022,Wonderful location right on the beach. and easy and prompt correspondence with the owner which made our visit easy.
38816854,Rex,January,2022,We had a great week here. The beachfront is the major selling point. and there is good access to town and all necessities. The neighborhood is rough. hence the 4 locks on each of front and back doors.  The house is liveable but musty and not well maintained.  Think basic and you‚Äôll need to be tolerant.I would stay here again. but the price would need to be meaningfully lower.
38816854,Diane,January,2022,Mary‚Äôs place was great! Beautiful sunsets. great location. Would definitely stay again!
38816854,Pedro,December,2021,Great spot right at the beach.
38816854,Rafael,November,2021,Great location right on the beach.
38816854,Vivian,November,2021,For me this is always the place to stay at Rincon. We love that the house is very cozy and the views to the beach are breathtaking. The attention given by the owner and caretaker are amazing. You won‚Äôt regret it.
38816854,Michael,September,2021,Amazing experience.  Everything is as shown.  Direct access to the beach and location is great for easy access to other sites in and around Rincon.  Kitchen is well stocked.  Check in/Check out was seamless.
38816854,Craig,August,2021,The location was just perfect. Beach in the back yard and stores / restaurants down the road. The view of the sunset and the overall vibe of the area was very relaxing and so enjoyable.
38816854,Ricardo,August,2021,Amazing location. Everything is close by! Wonderful beach. Look forward to visiting again.
38816854,Alberto,August,2021,If your are looking for a home away from home. with all the comforts and amenities look no further. This home has it ALL and more. My family and I had the best vacation time at this rental. The backyard and the view are breathtaking and AMAZING!!! You have the ocean as a private pool. The beach area is suitable for snorkeling. fishing and safe for the little one's. Mary was by far the most TENTATIVE and GRACIOUS host we had the pleasure of dealing with. BOOK with confidence and get ready to built beautiful memories. THANK YOU MARY!!! Can't wait for our next vacation to stay at Mary's Place.
38816854,Melanie,July,2021,Great location and communication. Loved that the back yard is the beach.
38816854,Response from Mary,July,2021,I hope you all enjoyed. our family and friends have loved spending time in Rincon for many years.Hopefully we will see you again. And thanks for being great gusts.
38816854,Paul,July,2021,We had a great time on our stay. The location can't be beat!
38816854,Vivian,July,2021,This is our second time in Casa Mac. Rincon. We had a great time. Communication was great. Every request was taken care off immediately. Great place for vacation.
38816854,Response from Mary,July,2021,This guest complained from the minute his party arrived. starting at 11:30 pm.. I do not live in Rincon. my manager contacted right away.. and attempted to contact in person 3 different times at the house. they were never around.. There are deadbolts on both doors. gates. there are not. Power outages are fairly common in Puerto Rico. we do not have a generator. how we can be held responsible for the electricity in Rincon. This guest failed to mention they were given a refund on that last night. This review does not reflect my status as a super host. or past reviews.Show more
38816854,Melissa,June,2021,Amazing property right on the beach! The sounds of the waves as you sleep and the sunsets are even more delightful! Very fast response from the host and great customer service. Highly recommend this rental!
38816854,Danielle,June,2021,Our stay at Casa Mac was great. We were hoping for a good beach and it was better than expected. If you are looking for a low key. laid back place. this is it. We  enjoyed several of the nearby restaurants and the locals were very helpful.
38816854,Robert,June,2021,A nice place directly on the beach
38816854,H√©ctor,June,2021,We arrived and called the alternate manager and he had no idea that the property was rented. He didn't even know how to direct us to make sure that we were at the right property. Pros: Amazing spot. ocean front. private gate. exclusive access to the beach at just 5 steps. Supermarket and restaurant in less than 5 minutes driving.Cons: Cleanliness is not a priority. rust is everywhere. you will be welcomed with a moldy smell. and the BBQ had no gas to be used. Walls are dirty. needs paint work asap.If you ask me. the price needs to be reduced. Property have a lot of potential and just need urgent attention.
38816854,Kyriat,May,2021,In general. be careful driving. Some streets are tiny.
38816854,David,April,2021,Rincon was beautiful and laid back. just what we were looking for. Awesome beach in front of the house. Do note that this listing is for only the downstairs unit of the house. Would definitely recommend to friends and will likely be back again.
38816854,Nina,April,2021,This location was awesome - so nice to wake up right on the beach :)We especially loved the fenced in backyard for our two little kids. Definitely a nice touch.
38816854,Vivian,April,2021,Spacious house with an amazing view. Direct access to the beach. You may even have a chance to see whales upclose. The house has everything you need. Host and caretakers are very attentive. Definitely I will rent it again.
38816854,Kate,April,2021,This place is so relaxing and beautiful. You can fall asleep to the sound of the waves crashing and sit in the sand out front to watch the sunset! The place was clean and perfect for our little family. Would highly recommend
38816854,Sarah,March,2021,Mary‚Äôs place is awesome! Even better than the listing. Location is excellent and being right on the beach is amazing. The fenced in yard makes it very kid friendly and Mary has some really great touches with beach chairs and even a bucket and pail for sand play. Mary is super responsive and easy to deal with and we would highly recommend her place for families. couples. and friends alike. Oh. did I mention the sunsets and sounds of waves crashing as you fall asleep? If you‚Äôre looking for a place in Rincon. look no further!
38816854,Ricardo,March,2021,Beautiful location!
38816854,Dionette,March,2021,Superb location. Plenty spacious for our family of four. Seriously. the views are amazing. I would absolutely stay at Mary Mac again. Thanks for the memories.
38816854,Kyle,March,2021,Mary has instant communication.  Her house is also better than listed: location and space is hard to beat.  Great value and great hostess. we'll be back!
38816854,Response from Mary,February,2021,I‚Äôm so glad you and your family enjoyed yourselves. Thanks for nice review. please come back anytime.
38816854,Response from Mary,January,2021,I appreciate your understanding with the electric. Wilson is wonderful. he was worried about the fridge for baby food. How did the babies knees make out!
38816854,Response from Mary,January,2021,Our family has enjoyed this beautiful spot for a long time. Rincon is a surprise. good restaurants. beaches and peaceful. The pandemic has made it difficult. hopefully soon it will be easier for people to travel and enjoy all PR has to offer.Show more
38816854,Response from Mary,December,2020,Our only hope is that you and your family enjoyed yourselves
38816854,Response from Mary,December,2020,I agree it‚Äôs a glorious spot. Come back soon
38816854,Response from Mary,November,2020,We are pleased you enjoyed yourselves. Rincon is a beautiful place. love to host you again.
38816854,Kim,December,2019,The house was perfect for my family of 4 (2 adult children) and my in-laws.  With the master bedroom having its own bathroom. my in-laws could have their own space when they wanted it.  The kitchen was well-equipped. and we were able to cook or bake anything we wanted.  We spent most of our time on the outdoor patio and in the water.  There were lots of outdoor chairs. an outdoor shower and hose. 2 clotheslines. and constant wind for drying wet towels and bathing suits or recently-washed clothes. In retrospect. we should have rented a surf board for the week just to play around with the surf.  There were some rocks. but not a craggy bottom with sea urchins like other Rincon beaches.  Being on the beach with the constant crashing of waves was incredible.  It was nice to have AC in the rooms for sleeping.  The neighborhood appears to be a mix of locals and tourists.  There was some noise from barking dogs. but the waves and the AC provided constant. steady noise for sound sleeping.  We had a car. but often walked to the grocery store and the bakery. We had direct contact with Wilson. the property manager. and met him once but didn't need anything during our stay.  We truly loved our time at Mary's house and. while we don't typically return to the same place twice. are definitely considering a return visit to this place.  Thank you for sharing your incredible beach home.Show more
38816854,Vivian,July,2022,Excellent place. Very good communication. This is my third time coming and it's still my favorite place in Rincon.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

29131595,Barb,July,2020,Best place to stay on the west side
29131595,James,July,2020,Great property and outstanding host.
29131595,David,March,2019,Location of this place is fabulous! We stayed in 2 places (next to each other) that Woleska manages and they were both great! This place is close to the beach and sounds of the ocean is great through out the furnishings are very stylish and up to date. The place had everything we needed to enjoy our visit... We had a fish fry at with the fish we caught from our charter fishing trip (which was so fun).  The beach and the tide pool was nice as well to relax in. The place is very very secure. I don't think we even locked the door to our place while we were there. the people who live here in the community are all so nice and helpful as well.  The restaurants a short walk up the beach were very good as well and a great place to watch the surfers. We enjoyed the town of Rincon and the various beaches around the area where we snorkeled and swam in the ocean. We also drove to some waterfalls and had a good time swimming  under the waterfalls and swinging  into the water from the rope swing. Woleska was amazing and so helpful. she helped us with everything we need and pointed us to things to do and places to go. We had a great time here and will hopefully be able to get back to this paradise!
29131595,Maria,November,2018,Awesome place and location! We will be back!
29131595,Rebecca,November,2020,Justo lo que deseaba. Excelente ubicaci√≥n frente al mar. c√≥moda. linda y muy limpia. Waleska muy atenta y en constante comunicaci√≥n. Esperamos volver pronto.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

12488542,Ana,December,2022,Excellent location. just a few minutes walk to the beach! House was well stocked and the hosts provided lots of helpful instructions for an easy check-in/check out.
12488542,Lorraine,June,2022,It is a wonderful place to stay. the house is cozy and very comfortable. I definitely come back.
12488542,Timothy,March,2022,I have stayed at a several Air bnb and similar like  vacasas and this by far was the most attentive and accommodating host I have ever experienced. I will definitely go back to this place. Thank you so much.
12488542,Pete,March,2022,Such a great time! Beautiful place. beautiful location. clean and tidy and with hosts that were very easy to get ahold of and were super helpful. 10/10 would go back.
12488542,Maxime,December,2021,We had a great week at the beach pad. thank you very much!
12488542,Anthony,June,2021,Excellent space for our group - I highly recommend and will be coming back for sure! Alan and Eileen did a great job maintaining this beautiful and peaceful space ; their communication was excellent and informative. The apartment was described accurately and it was in impeccable condition. A beautiful perk of this apartment is that the patio is only for this listing and is not shared with the entire building. This is simply amazing - we had breakfast and dinner outdoors at the patio. The location could not be better - we walked to beach . a handful of restaurants in the area. and an easy ride to nearby beaches
12488542,Jelis,June,2021,The house is beautiful and spacious. just like the pictures. We had a great time staying there even though it was raining and cloudy. The house is very well equipped with almost everything you will need for your stay. The only issues we had was the cold water because of the weather. However. we would love to come back! 100% recommend
12488542,Lilliam,May,2021,Excellent location! Quiet neighborhood. Great restaurants! Super chill atmosphere
12488542,Cari,May,2021,This place is worth every penny!! So clean and everything you need is right there! Our family said they wished we would have booked another day or two!! We want to visit again!
12488542,Response from Alan And Eileen,June,2021,Thank you for your feedback Christopher. We are thrilled you enjoyed the beautiful. tropical location and we did our very best to accommodate your various special requests even though often times you failed to respond to us after we offered you solutions. Regarding WiFi.  I would like to mention that you had 6 guests staying in the house attempting to work remotely and simultaneously using video streaming services and high volumes of data across 12 devices.  While we have the highest speed internet available on the island and use a top of the line eero mesh system across our property. we are not set up to support the needs of so many people with such high data needs as we are a vacation rental and not an office building. We can handle 1-2 people working remotely in each of our 5 units on the property but not 6 people in one unit. and especially when we are booked to capacity. No one else staying on the property during your stay had any issues with the WiFi and were able to stream content and use their devices without issues. I would recommend you inquire about WiFi capacity prior to booking a stay when your requirements are so specific. Also I would point out that Puerto Rico has a very delicate infrastructure and during your stay there we‚Äôre various power outages. yet because we have solar and a generator you were never without power. We are sorry our accommodations were not a perfect match for your group‚Äôs needs this time but hope you will consider returning for a relaxing getaway.Show more
12488542,Molly,May,2021,Alan & Eileen have a special spot to offer in Rincon! A great location in a cozy neighborhood with a very easy walk the beach.

12488542,Alisha,May,2021,Exactly what you'd expect! Clean. spacious. thoughtful. and great location. We had such a relaxing stay and will be back! Highly recommend.
12488542,Sean & Cristina,May,2021,Hello! Cristina here :) I wanted to surprise my dad during his 70's bday and I choose this house for him. me and brother. He loved it!

12488542,Sarah,April,2021,Gorgeous space. excellent location. A must-stay for the best the town has to offer. Flawless communication and check-in/check-out. Walking distance to all the necessities and beachfront. Couldn‚Äôt recommend more!

12488542,Francisco,February,2021,The Surf House was the perfect place for our group to enjoy a much needed relaxing weekend in Rincon. The location was perfect with the minj mart next door and the beach literally steps away. The patio area was a huge plus for our bbq cookout and outdoor dining. We will definitely book again everytime we come back. Hospitality was 10 stars! Thank you!
12488542,Shane,November,2020,Great property/location. Great hosts. extremely responsive.

12488542,Response from Alan And Eileen,January,2020,Thank you for the wonderful review Aimee! If you are interested in enjoying the place when it is quieter. consider coming to Rincon during off-season which is from June to October! It is very quiet in September and October when many of the businesses are closed. During off-season it is almost like a different town!Show more
12488542,Response from Alan And Eileen,January,2020,Thank you for the kind review Edwin! We hope to host you again soon.
12488542,Response from Alan And Eileen,December,2019,Thank you for the thoughtful review Abby. We are glad you chose to stay at The Beach Pad in Rincon. We hope to host you again soon!

12488542,Response from Alan And Eileen,July,2019,We are so happy you chose to celebrate with friends and family at The Beach Pad! Our goal when building was to create a space that is great for groups. We want friends and families to come gather and enjoy each other's company. but still have plenty of space and privacy you would want on a tropical vacation. Thank you for the kind review! We hope you come back soon.Show more
12488542,Dan,April,2019,Great location!  Amazing spot in the heart of Rincon!

12488542,Abby,March,2019,I stayed at Alan & Eileen place with a couple for friends for a long weekend trip and we absolutely loved it! They had everything we needed.  It‚Äôs in the perfect location.  We all love sandy beach so much so we were very happy to be so close.  They were quick to response and very accommodating.  I look forward to coming back to stay.
12488542,Emily,March,2019,We love your house!
12488542,Kevin,March,2019,This property is a must book! Amazing hosts. amazing location. amazing house. and amazing hospitality. I definitely will be visiting Rincon again and this property will be the first I check for availability.
12488542,Brie,March,2019,Our stay at Surf House was absolutely wonderful! We would highly recommend it and will definitely be staying there again on our next trip to Rincon. The house itself was very clean and comfortable with spacious rooms and all the amenities a group of travellers require. Alan and Eileen have included lost of thoughtful additions for beach life (coolers. beach wagons. a huge screened in porch with hammocks) and you are literally steps to the stunning beach. The area has lots of restaurants and bars all within walking distance - and parking. check-in and check-out are a breeze. Communication with Alan and Eileen was extremely fast and helpful and even a few of our additional requests were met instantly. We ended up staying an extra night because we did not want to leave! We're sure you will be as happy with your stay at Surf House as we were!
12488542,Marianne,February,2019,SO amazing! Great location.
12488542,Elisa,February,2019,Perfect spot for a group trip. close to everything and lots to do within walking distance (beach. bars. restaurants) which was very convenient if you want to get in a lot of activities or not have to drive everywhere. Any issues and questions were responded to within minutes. My friends and I had such a great time even just hanging out at the Beach Pad which was clean. spacious. and fun decor that matched the surfer vibes of Rincon. Would definitely want to book here again and would love to come back to Rincon!
12488542,Alex,February,2019,Outstanding surf house!  Beds were comfy. access via lock box was awesome. lots of beach equipment available to use. grills. coolers etc.  The kitchen was well stocked.  I loved how it was walking distance to 3 different surf breaks and a few restaurants. mini mart and shops.  A short drive gets you a number of other restaurants. surf breaks and downtown Rincon.  I would definitely stay here again with a big group 5 in this unit and 2 buddies upstairs in the Ocean Loft.  Extremely convenient place and Eileen was very responsive.
12488542,Sarah,February,2019,I cannot say enough good things about this rental! The Beach Pad was perfect for our vacation! When we told Alan and Eileen a 6 month old would be staying with us they made sure a pack and play and highchair were cleaned and available for us to use. The house itself is decorated very nicely and has thoughtful touches spread throughout. There was coffee provided to go with a very nice coffee maker. The renovations done to the home are very nice! Beds are comfortable and rooms are spacious. bathrooms are clean and showers are hot! The location is perfect. right next to all the good bars and restaurants and we always felt safe! The beach chairs and wagon are also extremely nice to have at the house to take to the beach. We will definitely be staying again when we come back to PR! Thanks again Alan and Eileen!
12488542,Ang,January,2019,The house has everything you need. From beach chairs and shampoo. a parking spot and an easy walk to the beach. restaurants. coffee shop and more... it was a great house in a great location. We had plenty of space for our group. Walkable to morning yoga. fun bars and the beach to watch some surfers. The house was very clean and comfortable and the hosts were responsive and super helpful throughout our stay. Easy check-in made it convenient for our morning flights. Look forward to staying again soon!
12488542,Andrew,January,2019,Alan and Eileen really host s wonderful Airbnb and I'd highly recommend staying at The Beach House.
12488542,Trent,January,2019,I've stayed at this property so many times that I should probably buy a home there but I'm not sure I could find a place paralleling the Beach Pad...honestly feels like home. They have expanded their room offerings and gave us a quick tour while we were there and they are all beautiful. clean. with views. etc. If you ever get a chance to meet the hosts. they are amazing but whether they are there or not. responsiveness is on point and they are extremely accommodating.Best place in Sandy Beach. Rincon...
12488542,Elizabeth,December,2018,Adorable house. Nicely decorated. Very clean and the hosts are wonderful. Great spot for a young crowd who likes to go out at night.
12488542,Jonathan,March,2018,Perfect!!
12488542,Trent,March,2018,This was the second time we have stayed at the Beach Pad. What an amazing location and space.Even with the challenges they have experienced with the storm everything was immaculate. They also have installed a badass generator just in case there are outages (we did not need to use it once).As far as the actual space. I would rent this just for a couple mainly because of the master bed and bath. Just beautiful and comfortable. There are also the additional two rooms with ample bedding and room. We actually stayed there with 6 people with no problems although unless you are couples it's probably more comfortable for 4-5 peeps. Both bathrooms are immaculate.The yard is beautiful and there is a patio section above the house which is nice to get away from other groups you are staying with if needed :)The next door building is an amazing restaurant with a small shop underneath that is perfect for anything you forgot/souvenirs/ice/etc; just all very convenient. Also. although you are not right on the beach. I never once wished I was closer...it's literally a 1 minute walk to a beautiful teal blue ocean beach with several options for eating and strolling to.Also. if you don't know this. the POOLBAR SUSHI restaurant is a walk away and is one of the coolest places I have ever dined (and is incredible food).And last but not least. the communication with the owner has always been exceptional. We were down on the island for a charity project and needed to ship some packages down. she accomdated everything and made it very easy for us to lower anxiety about that part of our logistics. VERY COOL PEOPLE.Thanks for everything!Show more
12488542,Caitlin/Jamie,March,2018,Great location! Definitely would stay again! Can‚Äôt wait to come back to PR!
12488542,Jessica,February,2018,We had a fantastic time staying here. and would recommend it! The house is a great size with fun hammocks and just a short walk to the beach. We loved it
12488542,Jorge,February,2018,We were Alan and Eileen's first guest post hurricane and the place was in amazingly great shape.  Rincon is a bit beat up vegetation wise. but it is coming back strong and still as beautiful as ever.  Business are up and running as well!!  The house had all that you need for the surf/beach life. I mean everything!  All three rooms are great. especially the master bed and bath. really nice.  Ice cold air in the rooms at night if you need it. but the house is well ventilated with screen doors and lots of fans.  In Jan/Feb. we were never hot without A/C.  Plus the porch with the hammocks was another nice feature.  At night we locked the security gates. witch too have great ventilation. and left the rest of the house open.  The neighborhood is safe and you are walking distance to some of the best surf and beaches in the World as well as a number of restaurants and bars.Alan and Eileen take extra care to make sure you are set to arrive. have access. they are communicative as much as you need them to be. and are quick to respond to any questions.  It showed they wanted us to have a great time.  So visit the Beach Pad. you won't regret it.  Puerto Rico Se Levanta!
12488542,Tatiana,September,2017,Amaizing!!! The house is gorgeous and great location
12488542,Bianca,September,2017,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Beach Pad. This is my 5th time to Rincon and this was our favorite house we've stayed in due to the prime location and cleanliness and design of the house. The house is very modern and clean. beds are comfortable and the A/C's make the rooms perfect after a long day at the beach. The location is central to some of Rincon's best spots. but I recommend a car to explore everything it has to offer. There was a minor hiccup with check-in. but Alan and Eileen were quick to respond and fix the minor issue. They were on vacation in Europe during the time of our stay but were still fast and efficient at responding to us and ensuring we were comfortable in our stay. Definitely recommend!
12488542,Arlene,July,2017,The Beach Pad is the perfect spot for a relax vacation at Rinc√≥n. House it's located just a few steps from the beach. restaurant and bars. When you stay at the beach pad you don't have to drive no where else. House is great . rooms are big and comfortable beds. bathrooms fully renovated . cable tv & internet. House is equipped with everything you need to enjoy your vacations. you can bring your own food and cook meals every day. kitchen has everything you need . For the beach you have beach chairs . cooler. beach toys for the kids. towels ...  our family had a great time including our pets . No one wanted to leave!

12488542,Paul,July,2017,The Beach Pad was a great taste of Rincon.  It was a true surfers' retreat with a very short walk to the beach and restaurant / bar next door.  The house was immaculate and had everything you need including beach chairs. towels. and beach toys for the kids.
12488542,Dennis,June,2017,The house is amazing. Super clean. has everything you need and located a 30-second walk away from Sandy Beach. Alan & Eileen were a great help and responded within minutes. Loved it.

12488542,Felipe,May,2017,I can't even begin to describe how helpful Alan and Eileen were. Their hospitality and availability made all the difference in our trip and definitely recommend this place to others and will 100% be coming back! The place itself is also amazing.. it's right next to the best bars in Sandy beach. all the rooms have air conditioning. the tv has Netflix. hbogo.  etc. connected to it. there is  a grill and a nice outside area to BBQ. and the house is extremely safe. Can't go wrong with this place.
12488542,Meryl,May,2017,Highly recommend this private home to anyone looking for a getaway in Rincon. The house has everything you would ever need and then some... Eileen was great to communicate with and allowed flexibility with our changing travel plans
12488542,Austin,April,2017,Couldn't be better located and had everything you need for a surf vacation!
12488542,Mark,April,2017,Enjoyed my stay at the Beach Pad due to the location. activities and the hosts.  Would definitely consider returning.
12488542,Response from Alan And Eileen,March,2017,Thank you so much Aaron for taking the time to write us a review your feedback is much appreciated.
12488542,Maxwell,March,2017,Alan and Eileen were amazing with quick communication. They provided us with flexible check-in and checkout times which made traveling a lot less stressful. The house is amazing as it has everything anyone could ever need. All 3 rooms had excellent A/C units and the house was clean and perfectly stocked with everything anyone of any age would need for vacation. The restaurants. bars. and beach are all within a few steps. Sandy Beach is a 2 minute walk away and is the perfect beach for swimming and hanging out. The house was also perfectly located around all the local surf spots so finding the best place to surf was quick and easy each day. The neighboring restaurants and bars were never a problem with noise as the property is well constructed and secure. It's a very vacationer friendly section of town and I would recommend this property in a heartbeat to anyone. I can't thank them enough for making my month in Rincon an unreal experience.
12488542,Matthew,February,2017,The Beach Pad was a great place to stay in Rincon. Walkable to a bunch of restaurants and bars and a few steps to the beach. Alan and Eileen were very accessible and responsive whenever we had questions.
12488542,Katherine,February,2017,The host was great. always made sure we had everything we need. We asked questions about local places and she responded quickly and had great suggestions! He house itself was everything we needed. The bedrooms were clean and spacious. the kitchen and living spaces were perfect for what we needed. Everything was an overall amazing stay and we will definitely be back!
12488542,James,February,2017,We had a group of 5 stay at Alan and Eileen's this past weekend. The location can't be beat. It's next door to Casa Verde and Kahuna Burger which had a great live band on the weekend. It's also maybe 500' from Sandy Beach and close to other beaches such as Pools. A few bars/restaurants are within a stone's throw. Eileen was very communicative about a small issue we had with the water and I appreciate her being so responsive. The home itself is awesome. Fresh. clean sheets and comfortable beds. The hammocks were clutch every morning. We didn't use the kitchen much but it had everything you needed if you wanted to cook up a nice meal. Overall. great weekend and will definitely consider staying at the Beach Pad again! Thank you!
12488542,Michael,January,2017,great house in a great location i would recommend staying there and I would definitely stay there again
12488542,Zach,January,2017,Alan and Eileen were awesome ! They have a beautiful home and they were so easy to communicate with. They helped us out in every way they could. Couldn't have asked for better hosts!
12488542,Dave,December,2016,Best location you can find. The house is within a 30 second to two minute walk between the most popular restaurants. bars. and beaches in Rinc√≥n. PR. Had everything we needed. I would definitely stay again.
12488542,Cristina,August,2016,We had a great time! Our last weekend before school started (Wed-Sun). We even enjoyed the rain! We had a very late arrival 10:30 pm and they were very sweet about it!  Everything is true to the description. walking distance to beach and restaurants. the house is comfy and you have everything you need! I was able to work remotely using the internet with no issues at all! The music. as mentioned. wasn't too loud. my kids 11 & 13 got to sleep no problem and it was only on Friday and Saturday but we were visiting at the end of summer. My son LOVED the burgers next door!  The location was perfect for us. I like being able to park safely and walk everywhere and its a nice drive into Rincon if you want to explore more and enjoy the sunset from different spots.  We will be coming back here for sure!

41809438,John,May,2021,This Villa is great and Waleska is a great host! The pictures do not it justice. The Villa is large for 4 people with 2 floors. The downstairs is very spacious and comfortable to hang out. The bedrooms are large and the spare room has a great bunk bed + extra bed for kids! The Villa is in a great location and only a 1-2 minute walk to the beach. Make sure to rent a car as there were no cabs or ubers available to get around town (we booked last minute and there were no rental cars left!). Surf is pretty great right out front. We will definitely be back again!

42564565,Response from Diana,May,2021,I will not host Bryant again. Unfortunately. the apartment was left in a very untidy state and there was beach sand in the bathrooms which required extra cleaning fees. House rules were not followed. the building camera recorded him dumping contents of the beach cooler from the third floor hallway which is against the building regulations.He and his companion accessed a suitcase that was securely stashed under our heavy bed which would have required at least two people to lift the bed and remove the suitcase. They opened the suitcase which had private items and did not put it back where it was. This is invasion of privacy. why would someone go through the effort to lift a heavy bed. access a securely stashed suitcase just to see what‚Äôs in it. and leave it open in the room.I addressed the concerns in a communication with the guest and received no apology. Instead he placed the blame on the co-guest and insinuated a compromise with review results if they make a payment. In all honesty. I cannot recommend Bryant to other hosts due to this disrespectful behavior.Show more
42564565,Nicole,May,2021,Super clean and charming apartment in a great location!  Check in was seamless and host was very communicative.

I am so sorry that a lot of the communication about the Covid rules of the pool reservation (Covid rules) will not arrive on time. Many of these regulations and details came at the time that were published by our complex management. I hope our resolution has been received positively and we look forward to having you visit again. post-COVID.Show moreTranslated¬†¬†Show original

8970927,Rob,May,2021,Nothing bad to say about the RV. It‚Äôs a stylish. unique stay. You have hot water and AC and a full kitchen with everything you would need to cook just about anything. Plenty of space. much more than you might think if you‚Äôve never been in an RV. The location is great. not far from anything you might want to do or need in Rincon. Communication with host is always fast and friendly. Honestly couldn‚Äôt come up with anything negative to say if I had to. Don‚Äôt hesitate to stay here. It‚Äôs great.
8970927,Ali,March,2021,Great place. Would absolutely stay here again.
8970927,Ingrid,January,2021,This RV exceeded my boyfriend‚Äôs and I expectations. It‚Äôs located very conveniently near beautiful beaches and variety of restaurants. it‚Äôs very easy to find through google maps. As for the RV. it‚Äôs better than the pictures! It‚Äôs super comfortable with a cool retro vibes and extremely clean. It‚Äôs equipped with everything you may need including a beach cooler and chairs. Only thing missing is eating utensils. Other than that. it really has everything you need for your stay. The host Zulma is super friendly and you can easily contact her through a call or message. My boyfriend and I will definitely stay again!

34398275,Though Tugcenur was clean. polite and communicated her needs. I did find that I was unable to meet her expectations. This is the type of guest that should be looking for higher price pointed listings or staying in a hotel. Tugcenur reached out 2 months before the reservations started to inform me that she was allergic to dust and needed uninterrupted internet because she would be working during her stay.    Though I could guarantee that there would not be dust in the apartment. I am unable to guarantee uninterrupted internet services. Our rental provides basic wifi needs. which is a private network in each unit. with enough megabytes to operate standard device usage. We cannot support nor are we responsible for anyone‚Äôs ability to work remotely. 9-5 from the property. We tell all of the remote workers that stay with us here. what to expect. and what can be done (bring a hot spot and noise cancelling headphones). along with where they can go in town (Public Library or cafes) to ensure YOUR remote work responsibilities are met.   Over the past two years. we have seen an influx of remote workers. who‚Äôs top priority is to be able to work from their rental. and they cause us too much stress. As Rincon Businesses Owners and Townspeople. we want to ensure that we are setting a realistic expectation of not being able to support the amount of data that is needed to run uninterrupted zoom meetings. while working with extremely granular tech tools and platforms. We are a Surf Vacation Rental First! We will never be set up as an office space. I let Tugcenur know this from the start. and never heard a response back that this would not meet her needs. At the point. I would have allowed a cancellation with a full refund. since I would have most definitely been able to rebook for,November in September.   Along with not being able to work because our internet was ‚Äútoo slow.‚Äù Other complaints I fielded from her about the property were bugs and the disturbance of our neighbors dogs barking (which we have no control over.) I had the exterminator come out. and provided an extra clean for her because of the siting of bugs due to the recent end of a tropical summer landscape maintenance done on the property. However. the day I was able to have the exterminator come did not work with Tugcenur‚Äôs schedule. Additionally. the owner‚Äôs of the property built a 10ft concrete separation wall last winter to help with the noise of the dogs. We also have neighbors behind us who rescue dogs. which is something we wholeheartedly support as hosts. townspeople. and animal adopters of Puerto Rican dogs.   She also complained about the maintenance that was being done on the property. and felt it should have been scheduled when they were off the property on the weekends.   It is important to note that we are a very busy property. and so is our maintenance team. We cannot schedule our schedule based on the unique. and ever changing schedules of our guests. Additionally. units are cleaned 1-2 times a week. It was cleaned the morning before they arrived.   Every single guest that came through the property during Tugcenur‚Äôs 2 week stayed really enjoyed themselves. I never fielded a complaint about the internet. bugs. or dogs barking from others.   Tugcenur kept referring to her friend's home in Rincon which has High Speed Internet. No Dogs Barking. and No bugs. Though their friends may not struggle with any of the issues that Tugcenur struggled with on our property. I know from being a property owner who lived on the island since,2013,. that Tugcenur and her friends may not be familiar with the intricacies and nuances of our neighborhoods. Some of us have great internet and some of us don‚Äôt. Some of our neighbors have lots of animals. while others don‚Äôt. And sometimes in the tropics. there will be a sighting of a bug. Never have I not encountered or fielded a complaint about a bug in a home on a tropical island.   By the second week. after trying to cater to every need of Tugcenur‚Äôs to keep her content. she was asking to leave the unit and wanted a refund. I explained that she was more than welcome to leave. if I was able to rebook the unit. I would refund her. I also reminded her that I set the expectation about the internet months before her check-in. and that it was not my responsibility to ensure her work responsibilities were met. That was when she went radio silent until check-out.   We walked away from this reservation as a learning experience for the business. Everyone involved in this property has been living. working. surfing. and enjoying Rincon for over a decade. We were all here before Wifi was the biggest demand of people traveling here. After taking Tugcenur‚Äôs reservation. we are going to be very firm with incoming guests - if they have an important meeting and work responsibilities. and think the internet is not strong enough. they should head on down to the Plaza in town. Like I explained to Tugcenur before she arrived. we have a library and some really amazing cafes to work from! All while contributing to small businesses in town that highly appreciate your contributions.   Lastly. one of the other things that happened before Tugcenur checked in. was her partner‚Äôs mother was reaching out and asking for our address so that she could send a gift to the house for her son‚Äôs birthday. It took about two hours going back and forth explaining that we could not do this. Though I understand the sweet gesture of it. we are not at the hotel. Providing a gift service is way beyond the service that our vacation rental business provides. Along with the fact that mailing something to Puerto Rico is a much more complicated process than it is in the US. Amazon barely ships to the island. it is not the same well oiled machine it is in New York City.   Overall. these are the types of guests who required and were looking for a higher end service than our property could provide. We would like. and will continue to cater ourselves to a more low key surfer and vacation demographic. providing a clean and safe place where they can get away. un-plug. surf world class waves. and reset themselves for a week or so.Show more

34398275,Susy,October,2021,Everything about this place was wonderful. including the host! I would return in a heartbeat!
34398275,Nicolas,August,2021,Gorgeous place. clean and perfectly located. Amazing balcony with great view. and well equipped apartment. Great value for the price in the area. I would definitely come back. but before that. I would like to check if the 2 things I mentioned to Sooz have been taken care of: 1) wifi bandwidth wasn't strong enough to handle videocalls - Sooz told me the problem should be fixed after I left. and 2) the dogs in the house below were barking at night for the 3 first nights. but not for the last night. so I think that the situation has been fixed
34398275,Ross,May,2021,5 stars all around! Lovely place! Spacious with a wonderful view!
34398275,Sophie,April,2021,Casa Pina is in the perfect location in Puntas! Close to town and great beaches. It‚Äôs very accessible with great parking. easy check in and check out and incredible views. Sooz was super communicative whenever I had a question for her. which was wonderful! The sunrises were a must see from the deck. and the apartment was very comfortable for the two of us plus our dog. Sooz had beach chairs. towels. and plenty of kitchen and bathroom equipment on hand to make our time here very easy. The neighboring dogs do tend to bark early in the morning. just as a heads up in case you are a light sleeper! Thanks for an amazing week in Rincon!!
34398275,Suzy,July,2020,Our mornings always started with coffee on the balcony overlooking the beautiful ocean views beyond the tropical greenery along with the melodies of many types of birds. insects. and the famous coqui frogs. The apartment is close to many beaches. restaurants and downtown Rinc√≥n. We had a few hiccups. which Sooz tended to and remedied as quickly as she could. One thing to know is to bring your top notch mosquito repellent. we were eaten alive and never found total relief but the apartment‚Äôs location and views were worth it! Great value for what was offered!
34398275,Angel,June,2020,This apt is perfect for someone who wants to live like a local. It‚Äôs located close to the best beaches and places to eat in Rincon. I miss waking up every morning to that wonderful balcony view. The neighborhood is quiet and people are very friendly and welcoming. Definitely will come back.
34398275,Dave,February,2020,Spacious. clean.  as advertised... great value!

32440697,Felix,November,2021,Little Malibu  is a great place to stay. the view is beautiful. We spent a nice weekend and our family enjoyed the stay. Looking forward to return. Allison is always a great host.
32440697,Joe,November,2021,Wifi is spotty but house overall was amazing. Lots of space and the views are incredible. Alison was super timely with responses and provided whatever we needed
32440697,Ricardo,October,2021,Not Worth the MoneyWhile the property has some nice features like the pool and the views. it is strangely distributed.  There is no access to the sleeping areas except from the outside. and you cannot gather it from the pictures in the app.  Also. it needs proper maintenance on some key areas.  The generator was faulty due to improper maintenance and did not turn on when the power went out. the railings on the top floor were loose and presented a security risk. the lighting was out in some key areas (bathrooms and dining area). and we had to go to a gas station to change the propane gas tank on the BBQ because it was empty and there were no replacements in the house.  These are simply things that no one should have to deal with while taking some time off.  We were excited to go to this property and to Rinc√≥n. but it was a disappointing experience.
32440697,Shenicka,October,2021,House was nothing but amazing :) few problems with lights especially in toward the rooms to the end of the home i was scared atNight to go in and out without the light other few small things but really house is amazing
32440697,Luis,October,2021,Great comfy. spacious and relaxing house that feels like you are living above the tropical canopy. Thank you Allison!
32440697,Hannah,September,2021,Beautiful pool and views!
32440697,Jorge,September,2021,Great stay!
32440697,Evyn,August,2021,Amazing views and great overall stay
32440697,Marcos,August,2021,Great privacy. breezy and comfortable for everyone who stayed!
32440697,Jordan,August,2021,Property is in an excellent location close to restaurants and the beach. We really enjoyed Rincon and it‚Äôs people and the stay was overall amazing. The grounds of the home are absolutely stunning and the pool was a god send in that heat. We found ourselves taking a dip in the pool every morning. afternoon. and evening - picture perfect. The house itself is very nice. but could use some updating. especially appliance wise for the price paid nightly . We found the home was well stocked and met our needs very well during our stay. I would absolutely recommend this property and the host to others coming to PR. and would stay here again if we were to return.
32440697,Neliamari,July,2021,Great place for stay cosy  beautiful relaxing  and very clean. 100% recommended üëç
32440697,Elsa,July,2021,Beautiful house but need some updates. Too many stairs. rooms are in at outside hall with individual entry. I do not recommended it if you have children.
32440697,Angel,July,2021,Beautiful house with view. Super spacious and close to main spots and beaches. Pictures are accurate. Highly recommended.
32440697,Lionel,June,2021,Great place for a family. The house is incredible spacious and fully equipped. You can cook or bbq while enjoying the amazing pool. Very close to a bunch of places so you can also dine out if you want. It comes with everything you need even if you want to go for a day trip to the beach (chairs. coolers. etc). Rooms are comfortable and clean. Would rent again.
32440697,Glen,May,2021,Super great place would recommend
32440697,Liselie,May,2021,The house was clean and beautiful. Allison was a great host!
32440697,Constanza,May,2021,The house is comfortable but given the price we found it a bit over value (due to the overall condition).   The kitchen is well equipped. one minus is that the bedroom with the bunker beds does not have a bathroom. you could use an outside bathroom.  The house definitely needs maintenance. there are many lights that do not work. the wood looks very faded (sun damaged).  Overall a good stay. good views and comfy house.
32440697,Stephanie,May,2021,Beautiful house with an amazing backyard and pool. The house has everything you need for your vacation. including highchair and playard for babies. The beach. town and restaurants are very close to the house. The rooms are on the small size. but very functional. There are two rooms in the second floor and two additional rooms in the first floor near the pool.  Three of the rooms have queen beds with bathrooms inside. and the fourth room has three small beds with an outside bathroom in the first level of the house near the pool. We enjoyed our stay!
32440697,Mariely,May,2021,Recommend it !
32440697,Christine,May,2021,I can't express enough how amazing this Airbnb is. It is centrally located in Rincon with everything so close by and the view is to die for! Allison was awesome and was always available in case we needed something and answered any questions I had throughout our stay. We went with a group of friends but each had our own space with our own bathrooms. which we really appreciated. We are already planning our trip back and will 100% be staying here again. We can't wait!!!!
32440697,Pedro,May,2021,Magical place! Everything you need is readily available. Had a family staycation and we all had the best time. The beach is a couple of minutes drive from the house and many restaurants are close by. Allison is an amazing host and always has the best listings. We all loved Rinc√≥n and fell in love with the house!
32440697,Betty,May,2021,Beautiful view. Rincon is a great town.
32440697,Mariana,May,2021,The house is amazing with plenty of space. nice pool. and beautiful view. Allison is very responsive.
32440697,Ola,April,2021,House is absolutely beautiful ! The view was amazing as well!
32440697,Olivia,April,2021,We had an amazing stay at Casa Little Malibu. The place was enormous. clean. and landscaping was beautiful. Great location. 4 min drive to town.
32440697,Natali,April,2021,Beautiful property with an amazing view. The house sits up high so the breeze is amazing! The rooms were really nice and the beds were comfy. Highly recommend  this property
32440697,Luis,March,2021,Amazing view. modern house . have everiting you need for a great stay .
32440697,Michael,March,2021,This is a beautiful house with a great view. We had great time. When there was a repair needed. Allison was quick to respond and helped to take care of things. Highly recommend.
32440697,Cesar,March,2021,If you like privacy this is the spot. Close enough to town to get all your last min needs and hidden to get your privacy.

32440697,Maria Elena,February,2021,Beautiful house. extremely clean. complete with anything and everything you need for your stay. Will for sure go back!
32440697,Diya,February,2021,Little Malibu is beautiful! The house is spacious. really well designed. and has gorgeous views. It‚Äôs perfect for groups. The location is nice too. It‚Äôs close to many beaches. My friends and I had a fantastic time and would love to return!
32440697,Kacho,February,2021,Very special place. It‚Äôs totally worth it and the host is super accesible and sharp.
32440697,Lakeisha,January,2021,The place was nice an beautiful! There are 4 bedrooms. but only 2 is connected to the main house. The other 2 is like a pool house. The one with the 3 beds are like bunk beds in a closet and we couldn‚Äôt fit in them. so we ended up just sleeping on the couch on the second level.There are a lot of misquotes. so make sure you bring some big repellent! There are a lot of roosters and birds chirping in the middle of the night. and a huge iguana tried to come party with us by the pool. so beware! LolIt was a great experience! The host is awesome and she worked with us during the covid times. The view was amazing. Other than a few minor things. we had a great time!

32440697,Response from Allison,September,2020,I'm very sorry that your one night stay at Casa Kuku didn't meet your expectations.  I work very hard to make sure everyone has an exceptional experience when staying at one of my rentals.  There is no excuse when the guest doesn't feel comfortable during their stay.   All I can say is that we aim to please but every now and there is a mishap.  My cleaning staff has been working in overdrive since March to make sure each rental is cleaned above and beyond the standard procedures.  I'm not sure what happened with your stay but I apologize and would like to offer you a free night stay.  Please let us try to make it up to you.Show more

32440697,Ashlie,August,2020,I was obsessed with the kitchen üíï
32440697,William & Lisette,August,2020,The architecture of the Little Malibu House in Rinc√≥n is the star of this review.  Located on top of a hill with view of the Caribbean and a lush green forest. the property makes the most of the views. the sounds of birds and the breeze.  Its location taps on the Trade Winds so that a cool breeze flows through the house always.  All areas of the property are arranged so that you have a view.  Even though there are homes nearby. you have a sense that you are in your own private paradise.  The design of the space also grants privacy to guests so that if you wish to sit on the top balcony. or any other part. you have a sense that you have the home to yourself. The rooms are on the small size. yet comfortable and functional. They all have ACs and their private bathroom.  The pool area is attractive making you feel you are in a boutique hotel.  The kitchen is well equipped although the range needs a little more power. The landscaping is attractive. and the backyard includes a starfruit tree with fruit. that we tasted and lime trees.  Rinc√≥n is also a great beach town.  We stayed there during the pandemic and felt the effects of Tropical Storm Isaias. which left the area without power for several hours. Yet. the generator made it possible to enjoy the home and the generator is placed in such a way that it is not a noise nuisance. In addition. Allison. the host. responds promptly to your requests and we are grateful for that. Despite the storm. which caused strong winds and rains for more than a day we found our stay relaxing and enjoyable. which helped us reboot our energy levels and spirits.Show more

32440697,Marilyn,February,2020,Little Malibu is a bit of Paradise in Rincon.  Tucked away from the main road. the house is set on a hill overlooking the distant ocean.   It‚Äôs quiet at night except for the tree frogs - the breezes flow through the entire house so there‚Äôs no need for air conditioning at all.   The house is set up beautifully with layers - main spaces and bedrooms on each level -  comfortable couches set under protective roofs where you can read if an afternoon shower pops up.  The kitchen is well appointed with all you need to make your own meals.  The pool is warmed by sun most of the day and makes a great alternative to the beach. although we drove to different beaches each day.   Allison. our hostess. is amazing - helpful in every way - she answers questions  promptly and handles minor issues quickly.   The info book available suggests beaches to visit as well as restaurants to try.    All in all. Little Malibu is the perfect location for a dream vacation in Puerto Rico.  We will definitely return!

32440697,Nicole,October,2019,There is so much to say about Little Malibu. If you‚Äôre looking to relax in paradise this is the place for you. The location was perfect - semi secluded but close to town and the beach. (A quick 7mins to the grocery store/beach and much closer to local farm stands). Allison was available 24/7 and was very responsive!! We lived by the pool and highly enjoyed grilling and lounging around. So sad to leave! This was our second trip to Rincon and we are so happy to have stayed at Little Malibu - we will be back!
32440697,Dan,September,2019,Great place. great location. well kept. Would stay again.

32440697,Response from Allison,December,2019,Wow.  I'm shocked to hear that you think the house was dirty since I personally inspect every house after each cleaning.  I've been a Superhost for over 5 years and have 360+ FIVE STAR reviews.  I have never had a complaint about the cleanliness of my homes. If there was an issue you could have easily picked up the phone and called me about it. I can see this is your first time renting on Airbnb and this is your first time reviewing someone.  Based on my track record I don't feel the need to defend your review any further.  My record speaks for itself.Show more

20583282,Pedro,December,2022,The experience was very good overall. Great location and a very good choice to stay in Rincon.Response from JenniferJanuary 2023Always welcome!
20583282,Ishaira,November,2022,We hope the hostess takes in consideration her complaints from guests as we later on realized by reading other reviewes that they continued to be the same ones. Such as: the pool not being in its best condition or the filter working. We understand many schedule airbnbs just to have a place to sleep. but there are other's  that plan a trip to get away from the world and just want to stay in and enjoy the pool. After a few complaints on our part. the hostess did offer us to stay at another airbnb and we are grateful for that; nonetheless we hope there are improvements made.
20583282,Yulissa,November,2022,Excellent location near the beach and restaurant. Just like the pictures. Great place for families.

20583282,Karellis,February,2022,Spacious. super clean and comfortable pad for short or long term stay. Not a bad walk to near by restaurants and beaches. However. if bringing chairs and equipment a car is necessary. Area lacks sidewalks. however. there isn‚Äôt much vehicular traffic. I recommend a walk to Jake‚Äôs Java for some coffee or a smoothie! About an 18 minute walk and lands you right on Sandy Beach.  We enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning soon!

20583282,Marinelle,May,2021,Good location and view.
20583282,Tania,May,2021,The place was ok... They need to improve in the cleaning specifically in the bathroom. pool area and in the kitchen. Also. if it is rented for more than one person and in the description it says that they have utensils in the kitchen (cutlery) and towels for everyone. they must make sure that it is. In the parking lot. the cars are located too close to the kitchen. which detracts from the privacy of the place. It has not been our best experience.

20583282,Roxanne,March,2019,Amazing hostess! Great communication. extraordinary place! A lot of special details in the property which made the experience unforgettable!
20583282,Maribel,February,2019,Great place.  I‚Äôm wedding plannner and florist from San Juan. We had a destination wedding in Villa DeZecheo and me and my team stood at Tropical suites from Wednesday to Saturday.  Nice view. Everything clean. Loved the illumination of the apartment.  Will stay there again in my next event in Rincon!
20583282,Laura,February,2019,Highly recommended!!! Close to most popular beaches and restaurants in the area.
20583282,Juan,February,2019,If you want to have great view. experience and pass the better vacation this is the place!!
20583282,Meegan,February,2019,I rented two units because the one I started with was available for only part of my trip. Transition to second unit was easy. Both units were very clean. The plunge pool and roof deck were nice. Proximity to Rincon beaches. restaurants. etc is ideal.
20583282,Ricardo,January,2019,Great place! Pool was right in front of us and the suite was very fun and comfortable.

20583282,Mariajose,November,2018,Nice Place! Absolutely will be get back! Thank you!
20583282,Niki,October,2018,Wonderful place at a perfect vantage point for seeing/touring Rincon. Beautiful mountain/water view just up the hill from town. It was sparkling clean with modern ammenties that gave us everything we needed. Outdoor kitchen might pose some issues if you're trying to buy a lot of food -- I would recommend this place more if you're looking for accessibility to the local area.  not for traditional functional living. Absolutely loved it tho. one of the best night sleeps I got while I was in Puerto Rico. Enjoy!
20583282,Yonaira,October,2018,We had a great time - central location in Rinc√≥n and everything was as seen in the pictures. The place was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen is outside. and the pool is on the small side (we had four floaties and that‚Äôs all that would fit). If you like to sleep in total darkness. bring a sleep mask (the patio/pool lights are very bright). Would definitely stay again.
20583282,Gabriel,September,2018,Awesome place very close to surfing spots and other attractions to done near by
20583282,Ritchelle,September,2018,Me and my friends stayed for a weekend. we had fun overall. but the photos need to he updated and the cleanliness could be better. especially the kitchen area.  We loved the concept of the game room. we brought our own games (being gamers) and the game room suite made us feel the scene.

20583282,Melanie,August,2022,We chose this place because we wanted to enjoy the private pool. however when we arrived the pool was super dirty. When I reported it. they told me that I had to wait A COUPLE of HOURS because Clorox had been thrown out and it took me a while to clear the water. Also. she said the filter had a timer and that's why it wasn't turned on. In the end. the water never cleared up and the filter never turned on. So we couldn't make use of the pool. Also. we wanted to watch the bsn game on the TV and there was no internet. but the next day they fixed it. Because of the pool. on the day of check-out. I was offered a partial refund.Anyway. if you are going to stay to spend the night. the place is excellent. comfortable beds. and good atmosphere. close to everything. Perhaps if the issues were resolved faster. the stay would have been more enjoyable. Otherwise. it is very well equipped.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

20583282,Response from Jennifer,December,2021,Isaac rented a property with two bedrooms and a bathroom and intended to have 7 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms (he cannot read). A great experience with these guests that I don't recommend to any other host. They vandalized the property by wearing keys. staining carpets. took control of the TV. and threw stones and food in the pool with bad intentions. By refusing to give them two nights for free or give them back the entire stay they started with threats. They left the property in poor condition. and after 2 days of leaving. they sent photos of the damage they caused themselves. Their profile doesn't have photos or reviews before.Show moreTranslated¬†¬†Show original

20583282,Amanda,June,2021,We stayed at this property previously but in another suite and it was a very good experience. But on this occasion. we stayed in this suite which has the kitchen outside.

It has all the necessary amenities. In my opinion. the pool being small is not practical to share with other guests. We had the experience that some guests were there for more than 6 hours and we couldn't use it until tonight. Already at night the pool was very dirty. The pool is in front of one of the rooms in the Game Room. and since it has a large glass sliding door. you will not feel private when other guests use the pool.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

651278972931444557,Eric,October,2022,We had a delightful stay; best option we've stayed in during our trips to Rincon
651278972931444557,Nicole,October,2022,This place is a hidden gem! We reserved this space for the four of us and it was absolutely perfect! It was our mother's 60th and 70th birthday's so we wanted to make sure we had a place that was comfortable for everyone and I can confidently say this condo exceeded our expectations.You basically have your own private beach. The waves were a little rough for swimming but we knew that coming during this time of year. No problem. lots of great beaches and snorkeling nearby. Not to mention there is a pool on site if you just want to chill.We were beyond thrilled with the amount of amenities provided and it made for a remarkable stay. The kitchen had full size appliances. fully stocked with all the essentials including a cooler. jugs for making batch drinks. cooking supplies and more. The AC was ice cold and made for a very comfortable stay. We loved waking up and drinking our coffee on the patio while listening to the waves crash on the beach. There are also some great little bars in the area that are easily walkable and make it so you have everything you need to have a great time right where you are. Additionally. there is a backup generator onsite so you never have to worry about going out of power. We will definitely be staying here again. 10/10 recommend.Show more

45783851,Carolyn,November,2022,It‚Äôs a great location and a lovely home. My family and I enjoyed every minute of our stay.
45783851,Jennifer,October,2022,Can‚Äôt say enough good things about Beinta and our stay!  We were there only 4 days for my cousins wedding but felt so comfortable and at home.  It was beautiful and spacious. super clean.  There are beach chairs and towels which were key.  It is such a sweet little community. very private and peaceful.  A great first experience in Rincon.Beinta answered every question I had before and during stay- got back to me super quick and EVEN SAVED THE DAY for my cousins wedding‚Äî‚Äî-the hair stylist for the bridal party cancelled on us the morning of and she found us someone who was likely way better than the original!!!!!  She‚Äôs a super-host haha.Just keep in mind you definitely need a car to get around to grocery/restaurants/bars (except for a couple that you can walk to on the beach about 15-20 minutes).  We may have been a little slow though due to a 4 year old and 10 month old haha.
45783851,Monica,October,2022,Amazing place to stay! Beautifully appointed and has everything you need to spend a relaxing time in Rinc√≥n. We‚Äôll be back. ‚ô•Ô∏è
45783851,Carlos,September,2022,It meet all our expectations. the beach was relaxing the neighborhood was quite and the house was beautiful!
45783851,Juan,September,2022,Excellent stay ! Highly recommended for those who appreciate the aesthetics of a beautful resort and the comforts of your own home.  We are new users to Airbnb and were very pleased with communication and recommendations that Beinta provided. The resort is private and peaceful...a great place to relax but is close enough to Rinconto enjoy all it has to offer...
45783851,Molly,August,2022,I have nothing but good things to say about Benita and this adorable place! She has the best recommendations and we just fell in love with the town and all the kind people! The place is so safe and the beach feels like you are on a private island. It was so clean and very well decorated! The town of Rincon is one of a kind. The beach was so close and easy to get to just a quick walk! Exploring was so easy and fun to do around the area!
45783851,Alyan,August,2022,Perfect Rincon beach house! We had a lovely and comfortable stay here and it was so clean and cozy. Beinta and her family are so accommodating and have really made a fabulous getaway spot for vacationers. We would come back in a heartbeat for the private beach access alone. but on top of that. the area is very safe what with the security. and our family of 6 slept comfortably with space to spare. Overall I would highly recommend this lovely AirBNB to anyone wanting to visit Puerto Rico!
45783851,Kelle,August,2022,Wonderful location! We enjoyed the provided chairs and beach toys; the condo was well situated for exploring the beach and for adventures into Rinc√≥n and surrounding area. The beds were very comfortable! Thank you!
45783851,Jordan,July,2022,Benita's place is perfection!Just a short walk and you have access to a private part of the beach. Our two kids (3 and 5) had the best time playing in the rock pool everyday. The location is great and it was lovely to see another part of the island. Benita is a wonderful host and her place has everything you need. A fully stocked kitchen. towels. beach gear. We had the best time and really enjoyed the beautifully decorated beach house. Definitely a place to return to!
45783851,Shasha,July,2022,Lovely Airbnb. super clean & spacious. and right next to a gorgeous. secluded beach. Host was very responsive & friendly. Highly recommend!
45783851,Karina,July,2022,This is the place to be! We loved our stay at Beintas place! We felt right at home especially my little ones. so accommodating & thoughtful of families with babies. you can tell how much love and attention to details this listing is! We loved the recommendations and had breakfast at the English Rose it was phenomenal and kid friendly. went to survival beach . crash boat beach and others near by. I can‚Äôt recommend this property enough !! Thank you for being so wonderful and welcoming Miss Beintas! Cheers
45783851,David,June,2022,Amazing secluded place with a bar right outside the front gate!!! Locals had horses riding around one night. Town is close by with plenty of places to eat. drink. and party for both adults and kids. Beach is nice but small and has a reef near the shore. If you love the sun it‚Äôs great but for sure not a swimmers paradise. Half way point between hotspots in the north and south like Crash Boat beach and Boquer√≥n. Locals are helpful and friendly. At no point did we feel unsafe other than driving around some back roads at night and not knowing if it was an extremely steep road or a cliff. Wonderful stay. Wonderful area. This was our first time in Western PR and we‚Äôre for sure going back.
45783851,Audrey,May,2022,This place is PERFECT!  The house itself is gorgeous‚Äîgreat decor. comfortable beds. and a nice kitchen.  The beach is amazing. with a tide pool my tweens loved to play in!  There were beach chairs and really everything you could want at the house.  Great location close to Rincon; we felt like locals by the time we left.  I was looking at options to re-book this place before we even left!  Great communication. easy access. and everything exactly as described/pictured.
45783851,T. Javier,May,2022,My family had a great stay. Good launching spot to explore some other beaches in the area. The pool & pool area were dirty. but that‚Äôs of course out of the host‚Äôs control. The host was also very responsive with communication.
45783851,Jonathan,May,2022,Everything was great. The location was a little out of the way. but not a huge deal.
45783851,Pam,May,2022,The location of this two story townhouse is fantastic!  Walking distance to the ocean with a wonderful tide pool our two year old granddaughter adored!  The local restaurants are great - creative. delicious. farm to table options abound.  No A/C at the places we tried but ocean breezes kept us cool.  The downtown area is small and has a couple of nice shops.  You definitely need a car to get around and there are a couple of restaurants in walking distance down the beach.
45783851,Nichole,May,2022,This property was very spacious for our family of five. Comfortable beds and the AC units in the bedrooms worked well and were appreciated after long days in the sun! Quick walk to the beach. And can walk to eat at casa islena which we loved. We had everything we needed and beinta was a great communicator!
45783851,Tallyn,April,2022,Gorgeous townhouse within walking distance to the beach. Master bedroom and kitchen were my favorite rooms! Had a eat stay and will be back.
45783851,Brenda,April,2022,Beautiful accommodations in a beautiful setting.  The villa is clean and  comfortable with easy access to a beautiful beach.  Beinta was super responsive abs helpful.  We‚Äôll be back!
45783851,Jolene,April,2022,Whether you are looking just for a weeks stay or much longer in the Caribbean. this is the place to be! This idyllic village resides on one. if not. the best beaches of West Puerto Rico. This beach is unique due to having both sand and reef where it creates a small tide pool for those that don't want to battle the Ocean's waves. Beinta and her husband were very responsive and attentive throughout our stay.  The style of the home was both modern and comfortable which made it enjoyable to be in.  A few of the many great amenities included a fully stocked kitchen with blenders and choice of coffee makers. central a/c with additional modern units in the bedrooms. and last but not least. the beds were the best beds I've slept in in any airbnb! Thank you. Beinta. for all the recommendations. accommodations and a beautiful space to experience this part of the world!
45783851,Elyse,March,2022,Beinta‚Äôs place is extraordinary. The unit is well stocked with beach and kitchen supplies. It is the perfect spot to relax with or without children. The pool and ocean are both within a 5 minute walk from the unit. We had the best time and were so comfortable with our two small children. Thank you for being a wonderful host!
45783851,Pam,March,2022,Loved our stay!  Benita was lovely and happy to answer all our questions.  The house had all we needed (and more) and was beautifully decorated.  The beach was gorgeous. and we loved Rincon!  I highly recommend Barefoot Chic!
45783851,Melissa,March,2022,We had a wonderful stay! Great location. easy check in. great communication with host. We loved having the private beach accessible only to this complex. There was a great tide pool for the little ones to swim in. Would definitely stay here again!
45783851,Rebecca,March,2022,This stunning property is located in a quiet neighborhood very close to downtown Rincon. The photos are accurate and you get a modern. comfortable. and clean property. You may be tempted to never leave the neighborhood because you also get a great beach. pool and tennis courts.Beinta responds immediately to texts. So if you have any questions or requests. rest assured that she will help you out.Get yourself here and enjoy the best stay ever!
45783851,Laura,March,2022,A wonderful house beautifully furnished exactly as pictured a few feet from a stunning fairly private beach. A dream stay - would love to return!
45783851,Angel,February,2022,This is an awesome place to stay. The pictures don‚Äôt lie! What you see is what you get and more! If you are looking for a quite place. get relax with the beach just a few steps away. definitely this is the one. The host is just super nice and the communication is excellent. Without any doubts I fully recommend.
45783851,Cody,February,2022,Amazing host. Amazing stay. Immaculate!!! Look no further.
45783851,Maria,February,2022,This is a beautiful location and condo. It was relaxing and the beach was amazing. We enjoyed cooking meals in the kitchen and socializing on the outdoor patio.  The residents and guests were friendly and helpful. We look forward to staying here again in the future!
45783851,James,February,2022,I have been coming to Rincon for 15 years and this is the nicest townhome/ location I stayed at. The beach is nice and quiet with  good waves right out front. The common amenities where great too. Nice gym and pool. I would definitely come back and stay here again. Thanks for the great time!
45783851,Liz,February,2022,Beinta place was gorgeous and so well designed. Will be back!
45783851,Ana,February,2022,Don't hesitate to book this place! We loved our stay and would recommend this place to our friends and family. The unit is beautifully designed and includes everything you could need for your stay. We really appreciated the fully stocked kitchen and the beach chairs/towels. The beach is a very short walk from the unit and it was one of the best beaches I've ever been too!
45783851,Kat,January,2022,I cannot recommend this place enough. If you want to stay in an interior design DREAM Beinta‚Äôs is the way to go. She was SO accommodating and very responsive. I had a lot of questions about the area and she was so sweet and answered every question. She even left us a bottle of Prosecco as a welcome gift! First of all. you are literally STEPS from the beach. Like. WHAT?! The neighbors were SO friendly! I would definitely recommend a car if you‚Äôre going to stay here but it was SO worth it. We drove to town. we drove to the rainforest. we drove to San Juan. Beinta‚Äôs felt like our legitimate home. We even missed it when we were gone! The kitchen was fully equipped so we could cook. She provides beach towels. beach chairs. etc. The space has a balcony where I would wake up and drink my morning coffee (thanks to beinta‚Äôs nespresso!) everyday and just appreciate being alive LOL. I haven‚Äôt felt so relaxed in years. It was just so easy to feel happy here. We were 5 friends but this is also really great for families! The room with two twin beds have trundles underneath to sleep 2 more! We were even able to do ALL of our laundry in her laundry room prior to flying home. My ONLY recommendation is to leave instructions on how to use the TVs but honestly I didn‚Äôt even bother to ask her because I was so happy in her space. I didn‚Äôt even want to watch TV. But I can imagine that might be good to have if you have kids. This is 100% my choice of places to stay if I visit again. Thank you so much Beinta! We all desperately needed this vacation and you made it amazing. Book this place guys!  You won‚Äôt regret it.Show more
45783851,Kirla,December,2021,Lovely place. really clean and modern. Host replies quick. and the community is great to disconnect and have a relaxing time.
45783851,Jorge And Nichole,December,2021,Beinta‚Äôs home is beautiful and conveniently located within a 10 minute drive (or less) to everything in Rinc√≥n. PR. I‚Äôd absolutely have a car given the location on the island. Beinta was very warm and communicative and we look forward to hopefully staying again in the future!
45783851,Dtb Florida,December,2021,Amazing location. amenities. and property. Don‚Äôt bother looking for other places. if you‚Äôre debating because of pricing or any other doubts. this is the place to go with. Everything was simply perfect.
45783851,Anthony,November,2021,Amazing location beautiful house everything you need right on the beach Beinta was an amazing host and quick to respond to all of our questions or needs
45783851,Fiona,November,2021,The house is immaculate. stylish. and comfortable. The beach is gorgeous and just steps away. Our family had a wonderful and relaxing stay. Beinta was a kind and welcoming host. She made sure we had everything we needed and made excellent recommendations. This is a terrific place to stay.
45783851,Vaughn,November,2021,Wow! Wow! Wow! Amazing.  very clean and well decorated place! Beinta was super kind. gracious and wonderful to communicate with. The location is unreal! Right by the beach. great restaurants. Love this side of the island! It‚Äôs a must stay!!
45783851,Steven,October,2021,My family and I had a perfect weekend. The house is well furnished with comfortable chairs. sofas and storage cabinets. My first impressions aside from the beautiful interior design. is how clean everything was. When using the kitchen. all of the utensils. pans. plates and cups were clean and felt practically new. The kitchen‚Äôs appliances were all up to date. And to my surprise a Nespresso coffee machine was available. The hosts provided coffee pods as well. An amazing detail that made my stay even more enjoyable. All of the bedrooms had comfortable beds. Each of the bedroom‚Äôs linens are of good quality and the pillows are great as well. All of the a/c‚Äôs  are modern and run quietly. The bathrooms like the rest of house are well designed with high quality faucets. toilets. lighting and finishes. What saved the day over the weekend was the power generator. All of neighborhood lost power for a few hours. Luckily the house comes equipped with a user friendly power generator. If it isn‚Äôt on a automatic setting. just by a press of a button the generator turns on. I totally recommend staying here. I will be staying again soon. Hopefully in the near future. Thank you to our hosts. Their hospitality was amazing.StevenShow more
45783851,Enid,September,2021,Loved this place. The decoration is so beautiful and chic.  The most comfortable beds!!! We will highly recommend it and want to go back. Super clean. modern and new feeling!! Very safe and private community. The beach is a 2 minutes walk away and it‚Äôs very private. Great for spending the day and watching the sunset. Very close 5-7 car drive to amazing restaurants. the town of Rinc√≥n and amazing beaches. All the restaurant recommendations from the host were awesome. Gorgeous place overall.
45783851,Kristy,August,2021,Beinta‚Äôs home is absolutely stunning. It appears brand new. is exceptionally clean and looks like something decorated out of Achitectural Digest. There were 5 of us (including 3 teenagers) and the house felt spacious. She has gourmet appliances including a Vitamix and Nespresso machine and full sized shampoos. conditioners and shower gel for each bathroom.Beinta communicated exceptionally well even though she was 5 hours later in the Faroe Islands. She was also very accommodating with a later check out.The house does not have ocean views because it is the third one from the beach but it is just a 2 minute walk to have your toes in the sand and surf. The gated and guarded community feels VERY safe. They offer a small. rustic gym. 2 outdoor tennis courts and a full size outdoor basketball court. The gym and tennis were often locked so we would build in time to call the gatehouse. There is also a community outdoor pool overlooking the beach which was attractive but we never used. We had a lovely stay at Punta Del Mar! Thank you Beinta!
45783851,Ginalette,August,2021,I loved the apartment! Had everything we needed. Very peaceful and location was great. Beach walking distance and perfect for kids. The interior decoration was beautiful. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The host Beinta is very kind. Looking forward to visit again!
45783851,Richa,July,2021,Beautifully designed home with comfortable beds. The location was beautiful -3 minutes walk to the private beach. There is a really nice spot on the beach that is like a natural pool. The WiFi is strong but the telephone signal isn‚Äôt great for T-mobile users. Overall. we loved it and would definitely come back!
45783851,John,July,2021,Highly recommended. as advertised and much more. Benita was an amazing host. communicating whenever needed and was a pleasure throughout. Honestly the listing undersold the unit and property. It was like we had a private beach the whole week. I can not recommend it enough. If you are on the edge of booking and read this. let it be the review to put you over! We will definitely be back!!!
45783851,Madelin,July,2021,Nice clean chic place. A bit tricky to get to if you do not have exact location. Small secluded beach area walking distance and not far drive to other great beaches nearby.
45783851,Blanquita,July,2021,This is an Amazing and Beautiful place we highly recomend.
45783851,Luis,July,2021,Great location and an awesome place to stay in Rincon. The owner is an interior designer and the place feels right out of a magazine. It‚Äôs absolutely beautiful.
45783851,Loriel,July,2021,This was our first visit to Rincon and I can‚Äôt imagine a better place to stay!  This home lacks nothing!  It is absolutely beautiful and so so clean! We didn‚Äôt want to leave:). It was the nicest place we stayed on our island tour!

We stayed with our two boys and the home was comfortable. easy to navigate. in perfect working order. and beautifully clean. Literally a block from the marina. awesome restaurants. a beautiful beach. The pool is an excellent size and very clean. The gated community was quiet and safe. We all had a wonderful time and Claudia is an extremely gracious host. We have family who live nearby and we will return for sure.
16984950,Chelsea,February,2022,Claudia was attentive and quickly answered any questions we had via messenger on air bnb. She was accommodating and helped to make our stay a great one. The house was clean and in a great location.
16984950,Andre,December,2021,Stayed in Puerto Bahia for the 5th time.  Villa Sirena did not disappoint.  The host was attentive.  If you want to be at the beach in a minute tops - this is the spot.
16984950,Carlos,May,2021,Location location location!!! Great place to stay. close to everything! Great host and customer service
16984950,Lauren,April,2021,Casa Sirena is in the beautiful Puerto Bahia community with easy access to the beach. several restaurants. and not far from local shopping and tourist attractions such as parasailing and scuba diving.  It is a great place to stay and offers many amenities.  There was pretty much everything you could need for cooking if you choose to cook at the house.  Having the washer and dryer was another great amenity.  The sleeping arrangements were comfortable and we really enjoyed the outdoor patio area.  A few things that are not provided are beach chairs. a cooler. a grill. and kitchen towels.  Other than those niceties it‚Äôs a near perfect place to stay!  Claudia was very responsive and checked in with us throughout our stay to see if we needed anything.  She even mailed home some clothing we accidentally left behind!  Amazing service!  We look forward to staying there again!
16984950,Misael,April,2021,great place near everything thats good in rincon.
16984950,Elaine,February,2021,This place was great. Feels much bigger than the pictures suggest. The location is perfect as far as being able to walk to restaurants. the marina beach. and the juice bar.
16984950,Yaromil,January,2021,Everything about Claudia‚Äôs place is great. Location. the pool. cleanliness. We will definitely return!
16984950,Anna,January,2021,Claudia's place was spectacular. It was incredibly clean and sanitized. we even got lucky with completely new bed sheets and towels :). It had everything we needed for our weekend stay. The location was absolutely perfect. a minute walk from the beach which was not very crowded and right next to three great restaurants to choose from. We also went horseback riding thanks to Claudia's recommendation with Pintos R Us. which meets also steps away from the airbnb. Overall. this place was super convenient and clean. and Claudia's customer service is one of the best we've ever received through Airbnb.
16984950,Omar,November,2020,Beautiful place. Great location; everything is near. Would come again.
16984950,Eric,September,2020,Claudias place is great. nice and tidy. and literally steps from a beautiful beach. Its close proximity to natures best offerings make it the ideal place to enjoy a relaxing weekend with friends and family. You have everything you need less than a minute drive from the property (i.e. restaurants. shops. supermarket. etc). The host is very responsive and will go out of her way to please you and resolve any issues you may have.Will definitely be staying here again.
16984950,Gilberto,July,2020,Really nice place to stay
16984950,Mercedes,July,2020,Claudia's place is on a great  location. It's a great  midway point to either the center of town or the awesome beaches in Rincon. The house has everything you need to feel just like home. Claudia was alwaysa text away for every question we had.
16984950,Joly,July,2020,The place was sparkling clean and in a great location. The beach is walking distance and so is ‚Äúla placita‚Äù. The house is right at the end of the street so it‚Äôs private. We had an awesome time!!!

23556111,Alvina,May,2022,The Perfect Rincon getaway! And as advertised. it was romantic and peaceful! My fiance and I enjoyed waking up in nature and enjoying our breakfasts the balcony and terrace areas overlooking a beautiful valley of cows and wildlife roaming around. We even had our own private balcony with a hammock to enjoy! Bobby fitted us for snorkel gear and gave us great recommendations of spots around Rincon! Location was perfect. everything was minutes away. The space had everything we needed including some extras to make us feel at home and was super clean. Thank you for the stay. we loved it!
23556111,Natalie,May,2022,This place is gorgeous! It has a great open backyard with a covered and uncovered patio and overlooks beautiful farm lands. The bed was so big and comfortable and there were kitchen and bathroom supplies provided. as well as beach towels. We loved having coffee on the porch and reading on the hammock seat in the morning. This is a very safe. quiet area just minutes away from Domes surfing beach and Steps beach for snorkeling. There is plenty of good food around and lots to do on the beaches! We were able to get surfing and snorkeling rentals right at Bob's surf shop in front of the airbnb. Can't recommend this place enough. we wanted to stay much longer.
23556111,Danielle,May,2022,Absolutely STUNNING. The backyard is incredible! Views of the ocean and greenery. We saw cows roaming and it was just magical. The place itself is super clean and I love that there is a patio and backyard to relax in. Overall a fantastic time! Super close to the beach and other fun restaurants:)

A perfect area with great food within walking distance. and a 2 minute drive from the beach. Robert has a great selection of boards at a great price. so if you‚Äôre looking a place to stay for a surf trip. this is the place for you.
23556111,Joselyn,February,2022,This place was super clean and there‚Äôs a really nice porch for hanging out!
23556111,Jon,February,2022,This was such a quainl place to stay and Bob was a wonderful host. We were so close to everything that we wanted to do and see. Just a hop skip and a jump away. our stay at Bob's place was perfect. it was very very clean and the surroundings are so beautiful. The cozy room is not to high on road 413 which is popular. In minutes you are close to seeing surfers and breathtaking sunsets.  Bob was very accommodating  and informative on the area and things we  could do in the area. We loved this place and is great for adults
23556111,Barbara,February,2022,We had a great time at¬†this¬†place. The communication was super easy and quick with the host and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located and the apartment is very quiet and peaceful! Would absolutely recommend to stay there and we will go back again.
23556111,Jennifer (Jen),February,2022,We had a great stay at this beautiful  bnb. Bobby was very accommodating and gave us lots of suggestions when we asked about spots to visit and places to eat. The bnb was extremely clean and cozy. and felt very private. We couldn't get enough of the view from the backyard and often started our day with coffee on our private deck. Rincon itself is very beautiful. We enjoyed exploring all of the beaches (bring water shoes. many areas are rocky) and trying lots of great restaurants with beautiful views (beautiful views are everywhere in Rincon!). I suggest also taking a day trip to Playa Sucia. It's about an hour and a half drive and is so beautiful you won't regret it. Though a vehicle with a higher clearance is a good idea. There are lots of bumps in the entrance to the beach!
23556111,Taylor,February,2022,Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better stay. We fell in love and will be back.
23556111,Daniel,February,2022,Simply put. we enjoyed our stay so much we cancelled our other plans and extended our time there. The place is clean. comfortable. has great outdoor space. and is close to everything in Rincon. Bobby and Raquel were super accommodating and very knowledgeable about the area. Highly recommend!
23556111,Elyse,January,2022,Lovely place. a quick drive to several beaches and the downtown area. Bobby was an excellent host!
23556111,Sunrise,January,2022,This was such a clean space on a beautiful property overlooking a valley.  We usually don‚Äôt book studio spaces but considering most of our trip was spent on the beach. this home had everything we needed and more. We got to see both the beautiful sunrises and sunsets from the deck which overlooked the valley. The rental was within 10 mins of pretty much everything you‚Äôd need in Rincon. Bobby was a great host. He recommended a place for surf lessons. loaned us flippers and was very friendly! It should be noted that this is a studio room with a kitchenette which is located on the property of their home. surf shop and another rental. It did not create any problems for us though. I‚Äôd definitely recommend!
23556111,Marco,January,2022,Your place was beautiful. Very clean. The view to PR was absolutely breathtaking.  I recommend this place. Very friendly
23556111,Anne,December,2021,This is a special place - so beautiful. intentionally designed with everything needed to enjoy yourself in Puerto Rico.  Bobby and Raquel are wonderful hosts and have created a beautiful retreat space - with extra perks like a loaner beach chair and cooler for long days at the beach.Comfortable bed and couch. reliable wifi. lovely porch with a great hammock and a deck to watch the amazing sunsets.I highly recommend this place and hope to return someday!
23556111,Lia,December,2021,My boyfriend and I stayed there for a week and had such a lovely time. The place is super clean and exactly what you need. Big comfy bed. huge closet. big bathroom. large patio area. access to a grill and a small kitchenette. We‚Äôd stay here again in a heartbeat. Great cantina down the road with proper cocktails (didn‚Äôt know we‚Äôd care about having a proper cocktail but we were there every night). the best empanadillas. and such lovely staff. Quick drive to downtown and many other beaches. Bobby and Raquel were there to help with anything we needed. very sweet people that take great care of their property.
23556111,Rachel,December,2021,Beautiful property and clean room. Great communication. hosts were very friendly. Close to all of Rincon‚Äôs beautiful beaches. Wish we had more time here.
23556111,Eliza,November,2021,Don‚Äôt think twice. Book this place. It has everything needed for a beautiful. restful trip to Rinc√≥n: plenty of outside space to enjoy gorgeous sunsets. an immaculately clean room. available parking space and best of all. two gracious and incredibly generous hosts. My husband and I visited during thanksgiving. Bobby and Raquel were generous enough to save us plates from their family gathering. They made our very special. One of the best Air BNB experiences ever!
23556111,Desmond,November,2021,Bobby‚Äôs place exceeded all of our expectations! The location is perfect. the ground meticulous. the indoor/outdoor space as clean and comfortable as could be. the price extremely reasonable. and Bobby and his wife so friendly and accommodating in all aspects. My wife and I could not have asked for a better place to stay while we were away. I would highly recommend Bobby‚Äôs place if staying in or near Rincon. Thank you!!
23556111,Gustavo,November,2021,This is our third time staying with Bobbie and Raquel. And won‚Äôt be the last!! They are excellent hosts and even better people. Our stay was just perfect. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more. This is the ideal place to stay and enjoy all that Rincon has to offer. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!!
23556111,Corey,October,2021,I don‚Äôt generally leave extensive reviews unless it‚Äôs warranted. Robert was an amazing host and his property was spectacular. The property exceeded expectations. was very clean. had a phenomenal view. and made us want to extend our stay. I rarely want to return to the same Airbnb twice because I like to try new experiences but I know for sure we will be back.Robert and his wife were super friendly and very accommodating. They own a nice surf shop and many of the things we wanted to do we were able to do without going anywhere‚Äò to source the items needed. For example. they have surfboards for rent. snorkeling equipment. and even a cooler we could borrow to pack a lunch for the beach.The property is manicured nicely with beautiful trees and well-maintained walkways and decks. Book this property and you will Not be disappointed.
23556111,Andrea,August,2021,Loved staying here! This was the CLEANEST air bnb I have ever stayed at in my life! Attention to detail does not go unnoticed. The place is even better than the pictures show. So very cute. magical backyard. nice people. easy check in / out. Super comfy bed. Would definitely stay here again.
23556111,Sam,August,2021,We had a fantastic time at this Airbnb. There are several good restaurants within walking distance and the location feels very safe. The host was very nice and an honest person. FYI Wifi was stable but not sure the speed could handle video conferencing. We would stay here again.
23556111,Bismark,August,2021,Robert is an amazing host. He keeps the place very clean. beautiful  and quiet. You will not regret staying at this Airbnb.
23556111,Franziska,July,2021,Roberts place was an awesome start to our Puerto Rico Trip. He was kind. welcoming and offered us a lot of local tips. It‚Äôs well located to go for a nice 5k walk or run down to Sandy Beach. We even got some mangoes and star fruits from his home garden. Highly recommend staying here if you plan to be in Rincon/PR.
23556111,Chirag,July,2021,This is a great value for price. Very clean. and location at a sweet spot that can take you to any beach in Rincon within a few minutes of drive. Robert is very friendly and takes very good care of the property. You will find the property to be very well maintained. with common areas of a deck over looking the valley. The property has multiple fruit bearing trees. and Robert is generous to share them with the guests. It was really nice of him to share the delicious Mangoes that grew on the property. He also gave us great recommendations for restaurants and local attractions.
23556111,Ainsleigh,June,2021,My stay in Rincon was wonderful! Robert was extremely accomidating and attentive to my changes in plans and unexpectedly late arrival. The unit is close to restaurants. bars. stores and beaches so it was very easy to get around! It was perfectly clean and equipt with everything we needed for a short stay. Definitely recommend.
23556111,Andrew,June,2021,5/5. must stay if it is available. Robert is a warm and gracious host and the views from the deck are out of this world.
23556111,Janice,May,2021,This place was sensational.  Sensational host. Sensational spot. Just sensational. Clean. Felt connected with nature. the beach and all the spots you need to experience. Bob was THE HOST. Enjoyed chatting with him. He‚Äôs a character in a great way. Very professional and human. You got to live this experience! Janice & Antonio
23556111,Wendy,May,2021,We LOVED the space! I would wake up and see huge mangoes and coconuts right aside the window and was reminded I was in paradise. The bed was the most comfortable. It really felt luxurious from the towels to the kitchen to the exquisite art pieces. We loved everything about this place and Robert was a great host. The roads are narrow and winding but the views are worth it. Would love to be back.
23556111,Chris,May,2021,Mar Azul is clean. comfortable and beautiful. I would surely have stayed longer and will visit again. Robert‚Äôs local knowledge proved to be a real trip asset over the length of my stay.üëçüëç
23556111,Melissa,May,2021,Beautiful island getaway.  Exceptionally clean and cozy. Feels like a home away from home.  The hosts are super friendly and thoughtful. Close and convenient to the beach and dining.
23556111,Danielle,April,2021,Bobs place is perfect. Like others have said. it‚Äôs spotless and the outside deck overlooks a beautiful plot of land and has a great breeze. And you‚Äôre literally a mile away from the beaches. the surf and food shacks. and the downtown area of Rincon. Bob and his wife were extremely nice and gave us fresh fruits they harvested in their yard. Tip on driving here - double check you have the right address in your GPS before you head out because service is bad on the roads and if you use google maps it may take you to the wrong spot a couple miles away. Highly recommend this peaceful place ‚úåüèº
23556111,Devin,April,2021,We had an amazing time in Rincon. You cannot beat the sunsets on the west coast here. Robert was a great and friendly host with a lot of very helpful local tips. Definitely recommend La Copa Llena for a sunset dinner. The best was very clean and comfortable. The AC at night was key.
23556111,Jason,April,2021,Very clean and cozy! Close to everything we were interested in. Great hosts!
23556111,Brianne,April,2021,I HIGHLY recommend Robert's place! I have never stayed in such a well maintained property and clean apartment. Robert has 2 apartments on his property plus his surf shop but the apartment is very private with its own entrance. patio. & hammock. There is a shared yard. bbq. and awesome deck overlooking farmland and an amazing view of the Ocean in the distance. We were awoken by the sounds of roosters and cows mooing which I personally loved! We felt extremely safe and slept with the windows wide open every night. The apartment comes with a few amenities like shampoo. soap. hair dryer. bath & beach towels. coffee. tea. sugar. coffee maker. and other kitchen appliances. Robert provided us with beach chairs and a cooler which we used everyday and returned on our way out.There is a dirt parking lot across the street from the apartment which always had a spot for us. We were walking distance to a pizza place. surf shop cafe. acaia bowl/coffee spot. gas station and empanada stand. Everything else we drove to but its all a 6min drive or less. You'll see Robert almost everyday with his wife tending to his surf shop and customers which we thought was so cool! He will have all the info surf/swim conditions. what beaches to go to. and a bunch of recos for food and activities. OVERALL AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!Show more
23556111,Margaret,March,2021,Bobby and Raquel are amazing hosts! I had the best week staying in Rincon. The town is magical and this accommodation is very nicely located. very clean. with amazing amenities and views. During the rainy times I spent most of my time in the hammock chair which I‚Äôm already missing! 10/10 recommend & I will be back!
23556111,Angeliz,February,2021,What a lovely space! It's cozy. but also spacious and comfortable. It has everything you need for a couple's retreat. Bed is comfy. bathroom has good water temperature and pressure. closet is super roomy and the kitchenette has all the basic amenities for quick snacks or meals. The backyard overlooking the mountains and the sea...magical. Robert was easy to keep in touch with if we had any questions and was very hospitable. Would definitely stay again next time I'm visiting Rinc√≥n.
23556111,Timoteo,February,2021,Robert's place is in a great location for a tranquilo stay. Just up and out of Rincon in a nice quiet location. He runs a surf rental shop so if you want tips on conditions. good breaks or to rent equipment he is the man to see.
23556111,Jessi,January,2021,We had a great stay at Bobby's place. It was SPOTLESS and perfect for our stay. We appreciated the thoughtful touches like water upon arrival. fresh towels. extra blankets...things that are not readily given or available at other places. We felt perfectly safe traveling and staying here during the pandemic and we were very comfortable during our entire stay.
23556111,Rodica,January,2021,Robert and Raquel's is one of the cleanest stays I've encountered with AirBnB. It is also very well maintained and the location is gorgeous. Sunset over the ocean views. patio with amazing views all around. 5 minutes drive to all Rincon has to offer. Robert offered free snorkel gear and gave great tips on things to do and best food spots.
23556111,Jennifer,January,2021,Best place we stayed in Rincon. Bobby is a kind host. We loved the room. the garden & the view. Would definitely stay again!
23556111,Cody,December,2020,This place is the perfect retreat - peaceful. quiet. clean. Bobby and Raquel are incredibly kind people and great hosts. This is the place!
23556111,Patrick,December,2020,This AirBnB is an absolute gem. It‚Äôs beautifully kept. with lots of lovely touches and amenities. It‚Äôs top notch on cleanliness. has a super comfy bed and is extremely peaceful at night... where you can hear the lovely sound of the coquis!Then. there‚Äôs the host. Robert. who is an absolute rockstar and so forthcoming with everything from directions. surfboards and just general all out positivity. The location is also really well suited. in close proximity to idillic surf beaches. restaurants and sunset spots.This place deserves an award for excellence and we hope to be back soon!
23556111,Geri,December,2020,Best AirBnB ever! Beautiful accommodations. close to everything Rincon. surf shop on site. and unparalleled hospitality. Book this place before someone else does and believe me the only thing you will regret is checking out.
23556111,Gabby,November,2020,The location was beautiful and the place was sparkling clean. We will definitely be staying here again in the future!!
23556111,Meghan,November,2020,"My sister and I had a wonderful stay at Bobby's Airbnb! The studio-style space was exceptionally clean. comfortable. stylish. and appointed (we appreciated the coffee staples and were pleasantly surprised by how much we were able to cook with the electric stove and other kitchen gear provided!). The place is located behind Bobby's surf shop. so we had plenty of privacy while also being near to people if we wanted to socialize a bit. The room has a deck with a hammock and table/chairs. all of which look out over a beautiful lawn. garden. and sun deck. The sun deck has views of the ocean and was a lovely place to take coffee/a sundowner. The place is also walking distance to the beach and a number of fun restaurants. We rented a car and found this airbnb to be a great home base for exploring Rincon and beyond. but enjoyed our time at ""home"" as much as anything else! We would stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone."
23556111,Response from Robert,November,2020,THank you for the heartfelt review !
23556111,Geri,November,2020,Staying at Bobby and Raquel‚Äôs place was the best decision of our trip. Cleaner than any AirBnB we have ever stayed in. all your surf and paddle board needs right on sight. and some of the nicest people we have ever meet. If you are wondering if you should book. stop wondering and just do it! You won‚Äôt regret anything but having to check-out!
23556111,Nikolay & Jennie,October,2020,Robert's place was exceptional. It is perfectly located off of one of the main areas in Rincon but still feels very private like your own personal oasis. The suite is situated at the back of the main house with a private porch right off the room and a separate sunset view deck for my use - I had plenty of areas to rest and relax. The kitchen. while small. is very well appointed with all you would need to make a small meal and have coffee every morning. Robert also runs an exceptional surf board rental business at the front of the property and has great tips for you to get the most out of your time on the Island. I have rented boards from him several times! I felt very safe here during Covid. The cleanliness was top notch and all local policies were being followed. I highly recommend!!
23556111,Meredith,February,2020,This space is great and quiet. Robert owns the surfboard rental shop with this property in the back. Very convenient for surfers! Great location- not directly in town but nothing is a far drive. The house was very clean. plenty of amenities provided. Robert and Raquel were great hosts!
23556111,Sean,February,2020,The apartment is as advertised. It's a small and quiet apartment overlooking one of the valleys. We loved our stay and are looking forward to coming back in the future. Multiple porches to enjoy some R&R or an afternoon shower. The location is convenient to Sandy & Maria's beach. Bob is an extremely knowledgeable local and if you are coming to surf look no further.  Highly recommend for anyone/couple looking for a great spot.
23556111,Guy,January,2020,The apartment was very clean and extremely well maintained. Having a surf shop there made renting boards super easy. highly recommended for anyone coming to rincon for the waves. Great location close to town. beaches and surf. The backyard is awesome and a great place to catch the sunset. Very welcoming and accommodating hosts. we definitely recommend staying here!
23556111,Joseph,December,2019,Bobby and Raquel‚Äôs place is awesome. It was SPOTLESS. cozy. comfortable and in a great location. They have a beautiful view off of the porch for you to enjoy. They made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. We cooked two full meals in the kitchenette and using their grill. it was well stocked. There were nice touches like coffee provided. beach towels. and beach chairs. We will absolutely stay here again when visiting Rincon.
23556111,Jorge,December,2019,Book now. you wont regret it. Great place. great location. awesome host.
23556111,Margaret,November,2019,We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment was clean and had all the useful amenities needed like shampoo lotion coffee maker and cooker. In a great location close to town and surf spots. Thanks again and we hope to stay again here in the future!
23556111,Gustavo,November,2019,Fantastic is a great place to begin.  The accommodation was very comfortable with a cozy king size bed. a big bathroom and your basic cooking needs.  There was a double balcony/patio area that was beautiful. not to mention the great deck with a view of the surrounding hills and a view to the ocean.  The place was spotless and the whole property was beautifully landscaped.  A big plus was the surf shop on the property as well that was run by Bobby and his wife.  Lastly and most importantly were the wonderful hosts of Bobby and Raquel. who made you feel at home with their wonderful hospitality.  They were always available while giving one complete privacy.  Their local knowledge of great restaurants. bars and surf spots made our trip even more special.  Bobby and Raquel are wonderful and we thank you again for everything.  We will be back.
23556111,Ky,November,2019,Stop searching and book Robert‚Äôs place now. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. It‚Äôs a great property all around.
23556111,McKenna,July,2019,This Airbnb exceeded all expectations- it was spacious. clean. centrally located and packed with thoughtful touches. Bobby and Raquel are so incredibly hospitable and welcoming! I recommend this place to anyone looking to stay and experience Rincon.
23556111,Tania,May,2019,Best experience we‚Äôve had at RBnB. it surpassed our expectations. This place has been taken care and arranged in a very thoughtful way. Do not look further. This place is a hidden gem. We can‚Äôt put into words how awesome. spotless clean and charming was this place. This is definitely the spot for when my friends. family or ourselves return to El Rincon. The location is perfect. very close to restaurants. beaches and point of interests. The studio is spotless VERY CLEAN and has everything you need. Not hotel cheap quality GOOD QUALITY linens. towels. shampoo. soap. salt. pepper. pan. toaster. rice maker. lotion. microwave I can keep listing but am sure you get the picture Bobby and Raquel deserve another ‚Äúreview‚Äù section - their amazing hospitality is an understatement. We felt at home. so much that we ended up hanging out at the place more than we typically do at convencional hotels. They are the best host (Period).Bobby and Raquel you both have a house in Massachusetts if you ever want to visit. Gracias por todo y espero verlos pronto  üíïTania y SamShow more
23556111,Giancarlo,May,2019,Awesome place!! Close to everything (beaches. restaurants. the center of the town...). The hosts were just awesome. We live very close and love Rinc√≥n.  Definitely coming back and staying here.
23556111,Cecil,April,2019,This place is amazing. The yard is beautifully maintained and the sun deck and terrace are great touches. Bobby and Raquel were incredibly nice and accommodating. We'd love to stay here again!
23556111,Nell,March,2019,This is the second time we are staying with Bobby and Raquel. First of all. they are amazing hosts. They put so much care into the guest experience. Secondly. the studio apartment is so clean and warm and beautiful that we will be back for a third stay some day. The views of the valley are amazing. The outdoor patio is a wonderful extension of the indoor living space- we spent a ton of time out there. The king size bed is super comfortable and clean and welcoming. Shower and bathroom are big and spotless. They make sure to provide you with everything you'll need for your stay (including coffee) so if you are arriving on a red eye you don't have to worry about flying to the store before you shower or have a cup of joe. It is in a central location. yet private enough. that you can get to the beach in minutes. have access to a nice variety of restaurants and lunch places. but the area is not built up like downtown Rincon. Perfect.We will see these guys again. hands down. Thank you so much!!!
23556111,Christian,March,2019,Super clean and quiet. yet just a few minutes away from the bustle of Rinc√≥n! We are looking forward to our next visit at Bob's place!
23556111,Wilfred,March,2019,This place feels like a home away from home. Clean. safe. and easy to get to with all the comforts you need.  Spot on local recommendations and easy access to just about everything made this a stay we want to repeat every time we‚Äôre on the island!
23556111,Sara,March,2019,Perfect little spot in Rincon on highway 413 (the road to happiness). Close to all the major beaches and great food (short drive). quiet. relaxing. clean. updated. and there‚Äôs even a surf shop attached! Highly recommend this place. Very safe and comfortable and we will definitely return back!
23556111,Miles,February,2019,Highly recommend this spot. Super clean. they provided beach towels. cleaning half way through the week. Great views and really nice place to stay. Super quiet as well.
23556111,Ben,January,2019,The short drive to several different beaches and dining options plus all of the extra things like providing bikes. beach chairs. and beach towels for us to use made our stay here so great. We especially loved coming back after dinner and sitting on the porch to stargaze!
23556111,Mika,January,2019,This is a great spot! It is a very convenient location. with great surfboard rentals on site. It is a quick 4 minute drive to the beach and the various restaurants. Parking was easy. The place itself has a delightfully comfortable king size bed. a handy kitchenette. and a lovely patio for hanging out outside. The place and the property are meticulously maintained. It was everything we had hoped for! We will be back!
23556111,Thais,December,2018,The Love Nest was amazingly good! We really. really enjoyed our stay in this lovely apartment. The hosts are super welcoming! Everything that you read is true: the bed is incredibly comfortable (loved it!). everything was squeaky-clean. the kitchen has everything you need and everything was new. great hot shower. the breeze felt so good in the porch's hammock. the deck below is great for relaxing and watching the sunsets. they have the sweetest carambola tree. and the views were breathtaking.

47596660,Carissa,December,2022,This place was pretty. right on the water and clean. Not very private if that‚Äôs what your wanting given the pool area is right under you and your balcony is connected to the person staying right next to you. The bed and sheets/pillows were really really terrible to sleep in also not gonna lie def would not stay here longer than a night or 2 and not really worth the price to me. It is close to town though and pretty views if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for!
47596660,Chelsea,December,2022,Incredible location with a view that can‚Äôt be beat! Beautiful pool also with a view. Breakfast was delicious. We will be back!
47596660,Ike,October,2022,Very nice property on the beach! Excellent host.
47596660,Moises,September,2022,Loved
47596660,Hector,August,2022,This property stands apart from the rest in location. facilities. cleanliness. service and value.
47596660,Jax And Charles,June,2022,Tres Sirenas was a perfect place for our family of 4. Right on the beach and close walking proximity to shops. Coralis and her team were always very helpful and welcoming. Breakfast and cleaning services offered daily which was great. Do bring your own toiletries and plan to stock the kitchen as they offered limited basics. Looking forward to our next visit!
47596660,Pedrito,June,2022,Very beautiful place!
47596660,Jean,April,2022,Great place!!!
47596660,Emanuel,March,2022,Wonderful secluded location. beautiful beach and very peaceful
47596660,John/Joan,January,2022,The best place to relax and hear the ocean waves. We loved this place. 100% recommended.  John & Joan. Para fotos de 3 Sire as. buscanos en IG-  @casalosjuanesboqueron
47596660,Casey,January,2022,Tres Sirenas is a beautiful and very special place. The inn. the staff and the location right on the beach make it a perfect getaway if you are looking for a private. peaceful break. We love to be on the beach and went swimming every day. There is also a peaceful lounge area and pool if you want to go that route. The sounds of the crashing ocean waves are always there. which we found to be a wonderful soundtrack to yoga on the balcony!  The breakfast included was always nice and fresh. Plus. there is a complete kitchen so despite high COVID. we were able to either cook our meals or find plenty of open air places to eat. The staff is AMAZING. They were attentive to the property and focused on any request. Coralis was a great host and communicated frequently. We also took a few day trips to hike/swim some of the local trails on the west coast. Love this spot and feel so lucky that we were able to start the New Year in this way.
47596660,Monique,December,2021,Amazing place. everything is close by! With a the most beautiful beach at your foot steps
47596660,Michael,December,2021,This villa was absolutely breathtaking. Nothing like a large resort crowded with tourists. this bed & breakfast was a beautifully decorated. quiet stay right on the water. We would take a morning dip in the ocean before eating the light fresh breakfast that was served in our rooms. The in-room coffee was fantastic as well! They have paddle boards and bikes for rental which was great. The sound of the waves at night was lovely. but if you are a light sleeper consider bringing ear plugs or planning on sleeping with the windows closed (AC was available). The staff were absolutely lovely and took wonderful care of us during our stay. We are already planning our next trip back!
47596660,Mariela,October,2021,Excellent weekend getaway!
47596660,H√©ctor,July,2021,First Class Oceanfront! This hotel room is super nice. well located. beautifully decorated. and well thinked furnished. We were received with a Bottle of Champagne. This post is for room #4 which is on the second floor. which has an exclusive room access stairs. located at the corner of the building which gift to you an amazing oceanview from any corner of the room. In fact. if you left the curtains opens at night you will be seeing the ocean when you open your eyes in the next morning. The breakfast each day arrived at 9am (aprox) and it taste delicious. The breakfast was homemade and includes fruit and juice. If you want to rent a place where you can stay in without going out and have an amazing time in a beautiful. secure. oceanfront place where in fact you can swim. THIS IS THE PLACE!!! Just make sure to stop in the supermarket before check-in and just enjoy your time here. The only thing that you need to be aware of is that you will be facing a very steep stair to access the beds at the 2nd room.
47596660,Mariela,March,2021,Coralis did an excellent job and was very attentive. If you are looking for a place to wind down next to the beach. this is it.
47596660,Natalia,February,2021,Coralis was very attentive and made sure everything was perfect for our stay.  It was the perfect weekend listening to the waves of the ocean day and night!
47596018,Jose,December,2022,Great room in a beautiful location sharing remarkable common areas next to the beach.  Included Breakfast was delivered to our room and surpassed our expectations.
47596018,Yuli,November,2022,This place is AMAZING!! The host Coralis and the owners take everything into consideration so that you have a unique experience in Rinc√≥n. The rooms are impeccable. it has everything you could possibly need to stay with your family. your partner. or to enjoy a relaxing time alone. The beach in front is perfect. cristal clear. it makes everything insuperable. The breakfasts are on another level. They really take care of every detail. It‚Äôs a beautiful experience that I would repeat thousands of times.
47596018,Alberto,October,2022,Beautiful place
47596018,Jonathan,August,2022,Lovely beachfront property with a calm. warm sea just a few feet from your door. Comfy bed. well stocked mini fridge (for a small extra cost) and easy access to all the Rincon beaches... A very enjoyable base for exploring!
47596018,Amanda,February,2022,The location and outdoor space is beautiful and cannot be beat. This is what you are paying for. Sadly I was disappointed with the room. the bed was so creaky and loud that it made us uncomfortable. I get the look and vibe of having an older four post bed. the reality is that it led to terrible sleep and us feeling unsafe on it. The one chair in the room was also broken as the arm was separating from the base. For $400+ a night I would expect better. We did not have any issues with hot water like other reviews mentioned. The breakfast provided was good and a nice perk.
47596018,Tess,January,2022,Lovely lovely lovely! Highly recommend this beautiful spot. You can hear the waves crashing right outside your door. Very clean and friendly!
47596018,Ivan,January,2022,Excellent place to be relax!!!
47596018,Marisa,December,2021,Location was great ! About an 8 min drive into town.Down the block is where you can find a bunch of little food trucks. The room was exactly like the photos. The view from our room was even better. Everything about this place was worth it. The decor brought an airy boho feeling. There are so many different activities they offer for an extra cost. There are even beach chairs in the room to access if needed for no extra cost. They provided a mini bar (in the room) for an extra cost. Host was kind enough to allow us to stay on grounds/shared area after check out. What was awesome was they had an outdoor shower and a shared bathroom If need  which also provided sunblock and bug spray.  Everything here was thought out very well. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a relaxing stay to visit this place. Breakfast was included. It came around 8:30-9:00am. It was different each morning. We stayed Friday-Sunday You can also save money if bookings are done thru the website. Coralis beach stay was a 11/10 !Show more
47596018,Jose,November,2021,Amazing property and experience!
47596018,Juan Carlos,March,2021,Awesome private special place to enjoy with good company. at the best sunset spot in Puerto Rico

14632337,Marie,August,2022,We had a wonderful stay at casa Vazquez.  The condo was very clean when we arrived and the owner was very responsive to my questions. While we where there. we lost power a few times and we were  happy to learn that the apartment complex has a generator that powers up all units.  The kitchen had a Keurig coffee maker and both the bedrooms had TVs in addition to the living area.   As a guest. these are nice perks that I wished I knew ahead of time. Having 2 bathrooms was very convenient for our family.  The pool is really nice and big and the beach is a short walk away.  My husband enjoyed walking to the bakery every morning and our family enjoyed walking to the town square on Thursdays.  Thanks a lot Sam‚Ä¶ we felt your place was a home away from home for us.
14632337,Daniel,July,2022,Great apartment. very clean and beautiful!Very nice swimming pool.Great convenient location!Can't beat having the beach in the backyard and all the stores across the street!Many food and shopping options within walking distance.Great communication and customer service from the owner!
14632337,Cristina,June,2022,Fantastic place. Great location. spacious. clean. and confortable üíï Will be back!!!

14632337,Sandr,September,2021,Great!!! place!!! Oh my God!!!! Everything so close the beach.shooping center.Incredible sunset view and the pool.The apartment so clean and perfect!!!!
14632337,Shirley,August,2021,lt was absolutely heaven. The beach was a few feet away and so was the pool. The town of Rincon was 5 mins away and the supermarket was right across the street. As I arrived to the apartment I was in aww. it was clean. convenient and beautiful. it was definitely a home away from home. I see myself returning in the near future.
14632337,Ella,July,2021,Sam is very helpful and available! Great stay!
14632337,MaryAnne,July,2021,This was by far the best Airbnb I stayed in on this vacation! The ‚Äúcaminito‚Äù to the beach was excitedly the scary best lol only Bc I‚Äôm not a big fan of lizards n such but so worth going through it to get to the gem of the beach you end up in. Simply breathtaking! No rocks safe peaceful AHHHHMAZING sunsets convenient supermarket & bakery across the street-I will definitely come again! No need to drive to the beach sport activities Bc you can walk up the shore to get to it-super convenient. Sam & the unit manager were readily available. helpful & accommodating.
14632337,Mila,July,2021,Awsome place!
14632337,Falanh,June,2021,First I want to say. I would definitely stay here again no doubt about it. But two minors things. the amount of hot water was not adequate. Both bathroom and the kitchen sink. Hope that gets taken care of soon somehow 2) There was no curtains on the sliding door that face the pool below. so people can see us walking around in living room from the outside if they looked up. Other than that. location was fantastic.  2 minute walk to beach area. and felt very private on beach. No problem check in. Had everything it described. Internet was great! Wife and kids really enjoyed staying here. I will definitely stay again like I said.
14632337,Gabriela,June,2021,Amazing spot! Love it! Volveremos.
14632337,Chris,June,2021,We had an enjoyable stay and had stayed in another unit in the building previously so we knew what to expect. The location is awesome with everything you would need within walking distance. The condo was as advertised but definitely an opportunity to add some simple missing things like hand towels in the bathrooms. dish towels in the kitchen and a baking sheet for the oven. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend.
14632337,Sarah,May,2021,Perfect location close to town
14632337,Marissa,April,2021,Felt safe. nice views easy to communicate with.
14632337,Jason,March,2021,Excellent decor!  This place was everything that was advertised.  The house was spotless!  The kitchen was fully stocked with everything to eat and prepare meals!  They added many of the beach items we needed to make a day of it....outside of two minor maintence issues we addressed directly we were very happy with our stay and would easily stay again...
14632337,Jose,February,2021,Sam‚Äôs place was hit and miss. Location is great. everything you might need is very close by. The complex has a very nice pool and is very safe. The apartment itself was very nice and only had some minor maintenance details that could be very easily fixed. Now the BAD part about this whole place is the terrace! The listing shows an amazing private rooftop terrace and we were very upset when we got there and encountered the terrace was completely destroyed and therefore useless. Not AT ALL like the beautiful pictures shown in the listing. We contacted Clarissa the property manager which was very prompt in her response and she told us that the terrace was destroyed and was going to be renovated. This would have been great to know beforehand but we had to find out ourselves when we got there and every single piece of furniture was thrown in the middle like a pile of garbage. So if you don‚Äôt really plan on using the terrace go ahead and book this stay. But if you are planning to book this particular place because of the terrace like we did. Just save yourself some time and book another place instead.
14632337,Juan,February,2021,Great place. everything perfect
14632337,Pedro,February,2021,Good place. good location. Owner was very responsive. Would stay here again for sure.

14632337,Ana,January,2021,Excellent place to stay. everything's sparkling clean. Walking distance from the beach.  supermarkets and restaurants.  The apartment has the most amazing view of the sunset. We love our stay at Sam's place.

14632337,John,October,2020,Casa Vazquez is a beautiful place to stay. It has a perfect location. near the beach & amazing amenities. We‚Äôll definitely stay there again quite soon.
14632337,Manuel,September,2020,Everything was great. Casa Vasquez was a lifesaver! We are grateful we got this place available the moment we needed a new place to stay. Since our original booking at a house in the area had faulty electrical issues. discovered upon checking in needing attention. which had to be cancelled.  Casa Vasquez has everything and was a perfect place for us.  Very good location. walking distance to grocery. bakery and shops and had nearby restaurants.  We appreciate the thoughtful touches too. ensuring comfort for guests.  We would definitely stay there again on our next visit!
14632337,David,August,2020,Great place! Close to many amenities. Higly recommended.
14632337,Layne,August,2020,I had a very nice stay in Rinc√≥n! This Airbnb has a great location and A/C in the living/dining room as well as the bedrooms (bit of a challenge to find in Puerto Rico!). It was also very clean‚Äîthe host left an exhaustive check list for the cleaning person which I found on the kitchen counter with the gate fob upon arrival. The only things I wished for in the apartment were a bedside lamp. a colander. and kitchen towels. I got some towels from Walgreens and left them in the kitchen so maybe you will find them there when you visit! =) Another factor in my choice to stay here was the fact that the building has a generator and backup water in case the utilities are not working. The electricity did go out three times on my first day (there was no storm. but the locals said they were doing work on the grid after Tropical Storm Isaias. which happened several days before I checked in) so I was very glad to have the generator to keep the A/C and wifi working.
14632337,Milena,July,2020,Great please. we enjoyed every part of our stay! Sam‚Äôs place was very cozy and clean! Awesome view and great communication ‚ù§Ô∏è

14632337,Amy,March,2019,The place was exceptional!! The view of the ocean and channel gave view to more nature. The brief hike to beach was well worth the access to the shoreline. It made for a nice span to get a morning/evening run. My family enjoyed the bakery across the street. The location was convenient to all beaches/downtown without having to deal with parking and traffic. The price was extremely reasonable allowing a family space and convenience for cooking and washing clothes. Ricon has blessed us you have a treasure.
14632337,Mina,March,2019,We loved staying here! Make sure to get a rental car but other than that. it was a great location. and a lovely apartment!

The wifi worked great. The balcony over looking the pool and the ocean was nice to sit out and relax in the evenings listening to the Coquis. The condo has water reserve and generator so you are never without power or water. Behind the condo is a very secluded beach that is all sand. if you want to go to a private beach away from all the noise this is perfect.

The view was stunning. especially at sunset. The bed was very comfortable. We appreciated the many listed amenities - particularly the extra beach towels and chairs/umbrella/cooler. The bathroom also had shampoo. conditioner. and even a spare razor. The kitchen has all the necessary things to cook easily. and ground coffee was there to use. Wi-Fi was strong and TV had all the apps. Overall very comfortable stay and well worth every penny! Thank you for having us! üíó

43882738,Response from Mango,September,2022,Hi Carmen. thank you for taking the time to write a review and appreciate your patience with the construction. We are less than a week away from having the pool complete with an infinity edge. The listing has the box checked for noise and a detailed description but since there is so much information it may been overlooked. In the meantime. the property is peaceful from 2 p.m. until 7 a.m. and on weekends. In the future. please communicate any questions. comments or concerns with the hosts during your stay. We have happily relocated guests to quieter accommodations on the property and addressed any issue immediately. Better experience for all.Show more

43882738,Jeff,May,2022,This place is amazing. Beautiful views. well equipped with everything you need. and just a perfect little spot to come home to after a long day out @ the beach. Despite its proximity to everything in Rincon you‚Äôll find it hard to leave once you get settled in on that balcony.

43882738,Ana,March,2022,This is a great apartment about a 7 minute drive from Rincon center and 10 or so minute drive to the beach. Very quiet and peaceful area with nice views all around. The apartment itself has anything you need. including snorkeling gear and beach chairs and umbrella. which we took full advantage of. Great kitchenette and super comfortable bed. Highly recommend!
43882738,Adam,March,2022,Mango Mountain is truly an unforgettable experience. The view and surrounding area are beautiful and you are surrounded by nature. Be sure to take advantage of the services offered here! It will bring you back to life. The bed was comfortable and the tub and shower had great hot water and pressure. Can‚Äôt wait for our next stay here!
43882738,Derek,March,2022,Unit #7 at Mango Mountain was a good stay. but not great. Aesthetics are what provided the overall positive value ‚Äî easy access. modern and open space. balcony with great view of the greenery and ocean. Supplemental items for the beach were very useful as well. There is a pool that is currently being constructed right outside the unit. which seemed to be the cause of some plumbing issues (hot water not working properly. low water pressure). and the toilet would continue to run. causing a leak that seeped out the toilet room into the outside bathroom area‚Ä¶.We also had a problem with the AC where it did not work half the time. The hosts were very quick and responsive to these issues though. setting up prompt appointments  for a plumber and AC technician to come resolve the issues for us. I feel like it was just a bit of bad luck with the unit those couple of days. I would recommend this stay for those who enjoy a good view from the mountain area and don‚Äôt mind driving to the beaches or into town.Show more

If the water was running in your apartment we hope that you would contact management to resolve the issue. We are also confused how you would hear a neighbor sweep and mop through a concrete wall.  Though accuracy was a 2 star for you. we are happy you rated us 5 stars on all of the other categories.Show more
43882738,Jacob,November,2021,Excellent. Clean and sleek space. great location and views.

43882738,Rafael,June,2021,Excellent location. Adequate parking space. Absolute silence in the night. respectful guests. Will be back!
43882738,Angelin,May,2021,This location was amazingly beautiful. I loved going out every morning to see the cows. in the neighboring property. The view was like no other and the studio #7 was absolutely everything maybe even more than what I imagined from the pictures. Once I got familiarized with the area it was VERY easy to go to and from places. Close to so many things. I had a few questions on my first night as I arrived later than expected and the hosts were so helpful and punctual. I will be coming back and have already told my friends about Mango Mountain.
43882738,Response from Mango,May,2021,Hi Kayla. thank you so much for staying with us. We are happy to let you know we have hard wired internet now.
43882738,Sylvette,May,2021,Great place. super clean. very comfortable. Host is super responsive.
43882738,Tiffany,May,2021,This apartment was much lovelier than I had expected. I loved the open layout. the shower/bathtub. and the decor. My boyfriend and I only stayed here two nights. but I would imagine that long stays would be better because of the fully functional kitchen. Location is a little far from stores/restaurants. but walking was fun (but not recommended because of the small curvy roads). I definitely recommend this place to anyone.
43882738,Nilsa,May,2021,Mango Mountain is a Great location with amazing views. Everything went perfectly. easy check in / check out. studio well equipped. very clean and with beautiful and thoughtful touches. Definitely coming back.
43882738,Elda Marie,May,2021,Everything was so nice and clean! The studio looks even better in person. we loved every single thing about itü•∞
43882738,Brian,May,2021,Home away from home in a beautiful location. If you‚Äôre looking for a getaway. this is the spot! Few minutes from the main town. good eats. grocery stores and even a mechanic if you need one! The place is quiet. lots of open space in the front to hang out.
43882738,Stefanie,May,2021,I stayed in Joseph‚Äôs apartment with my partner and my pup. All 3 of us had a wonderful time. The place was super clean and fresh when we got there. plus that view! My gosh. definitely want to stay again. we didn‚Äôt want to leave! The only slight problems we encountered were with the internet connection; it got really slow at times. particularly at night. And secondly. sometimes the hot water would just go away momentarily. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal for me. because it would come back eventually. Apart from these two things. we really had a wonderful time. I definitely want to stay again. Totally recommend!
43882738,Lisa,April,2021,Amazing view to the ocean. Perfect and clean place. Recommend 100%!!!
43882738,Alena,April,2021,I stayed in several Airbnbs during my trip to Puerto Rico. and this one takes the cake. I would live here forever if I could.

43882738,Taryn,March,2021,I can‚Äôt recommend staying at Joseph‚Äôs place enough. It exceeded every expectation in terms of comfort. style and location. You won‚Äôt be able to get enough of the view from the balcony or the sunlight in the morning from the coziest bed !  Close to everything and feels like home. I can‚Äôt wait to come back.
43882738,Charluz M,March,2021,Excellent place and view
43882738,Jordan,March,2021,Loved this place!

43882738,Theresa,March,2021,After extending our trip we stayed at  Mango Mountain three times!  Our last stay in #7 was amazing!   It is so spacious and the private balcony view is great!   I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place!
43882738,Dan,March,2021,5 stars in every category! For my next trip to Rinc√≥n. if this unit is available. I will undoubtably stay here again!
43882738,Maricristi,March,2021,The place was great. The only thing was the sewage lines that we could hear the water running every time and the water heater. It didn‚Äôt work as expected.
43882738,Dan,February,2021,This property gets 5 Stars across the board. If I was to pick an aspect that exceeds the 5th Star... it‚Äôs the view. World class sunsets that will melt your heart ‚ù§Ô∏è.
43882738,Stephanie,February,2021,The place is amazing. Very clean and great for a couples retreat. Amazing view of the sea.  Would definitely book again.
43882738,Gracie,February,2021,Book it. The views are amazing. the house is newly updated. and the absolute perfect getaway location. You‚Äôre close to all of the areas around Rincon. We loved watching the sunset here.
43882738,Finn,February,2021,I‚Äôve stayed in a lot of air bnbs in Rincon and this is without a doubt the best. An immaculate and stylish space with incredible views. All the comforts of a NYC loft in tropical paradise. Hosts are very welcoming and accommodating. Don‚Äôt even second guess it. this is the Rincon air bnb you are looking for.
43882738,Jan M,February,2021,Nice and quiet place to stay.
43882738,Ana Maria,January,2021,Beautiful view and peaceful spot in Rinc√≥n. This apartment is very well situated to explore the beaches and nearby towns. Everything looks new. clean and nicely decorated. The host is very attentive to his guests. I think is a great value. Highly recommend for a weekend escape!
43882738,Rodnnie,January,2021,Great location and stylish + cozy space. Loved the view and experiencing silence at night while in the outdoor area. Joseph shared the info about the stay in a clear manner and everything went smoothly. Would definitely stay again!
43882738,Anna,January,2021,This property has incredible views. The location is perfect in a hill overlooking the ocean and the flora.  It's only a short drive to all the surf beaches. restaurants. shops. markets.  I'm looking forward to return.
43882738,Susabel,January,2021,Perfect place ü§ç
43882738,Daly,January,2021,Good location
43882738,Paula,January,2021,We stayed for one night a Joshep's place and it was a pleasant first time at an Airbnb. The place was very clean and it's stylish. just like the pictures. The bed was very comfortable. It has a nice view and a small terrace we didn't get the chance to use but the sunset there must be beautiful. Thank you Joseph!
43882738,Alexandra,January,2021,Great spot for a quick escape and easy access to the town and restaurants. It was quiet. and we were able to cook and have our own little balcony. We didn't bump into other guest while staying and the parking is right in front of the room. It had good indoor and outdoor lighting. Even though other reviews mention there was no air conditioning. there is one installed and works great. On the last night the entire town was left without power and we did not have an electric generator. Thankfully the night was not sufferable and the room stayed nice and chilled the whole night through.
43882738,Luis Alejandro,January,2021,Stop your search. this is it! One of the best place I‚Äôve stayed in Rincon for a while. you will not regret it.
43882738,Crystal,January,2021,The view is simply amazing. The apartment itself was extremely clean and we felt very assured that the necessary precautions were taken to ensure everyone‚Äôs safety. Would without a doubt book again in the near future.
43882738,Danitza,December,2020,More than expected. üí•ample space to be creative and enjoy working!
43882738,Naysha,December,2020,Such a great place!Has an amazing view and the sunsets are breathtaking. A lovely cozy place in the mountain with a great view of the sea meeting the sky. Very stylish and modern.  When visiting is better to follow the written directions rather than using the pin.
43882738,Mike & Carolina,December,2020,Great location with balcony and a view.  Bed was comfy and towels smelled fresh. Joseph replied quickly and was very accommodating. We fell in love with the details. You can tell it will only get better as they were upgrading some things around property.
43882738,Alejandro,December,2020,Great for couples. It has a spectacular view for sunsets and the place is very clean.
43882738,Jeffrey,December,2020,The studio is small but comfortable. the space is stylish.  It seemed a safe area.  The view is quite impressive off the back porch - the sun sets directly over the water. which is juxtaposed against the green hills.  The property is up high and looks down on both.  It‚Äôs a 5 min drive on good roads to Downtown.  Finding it for the first time in the dark was a challenge. The appliances including stove/oven/fridge are newer. were spotless and in good working order.  Internet was slow. but I didn‚Äôt really care about that.  Would definitely stay there again.  Joseph was nicely responsive
43882738,Cristina,December,2020,Amazing stay and prt friendly :)
43882738,Alicia,December,2020,Really nice place. very stylish and has great views.

43882738,Luzanne,October,2020,This place is wonderful. relaxing. beautiful and a great escape. Beautiful apartment and an amazing view for sunsets. clean and safe.
43882738,Ema,October,2020,A good place to stay
43882738,Chase,October,2020,We had an amazing time staying at Joseph's place. The space was super stylish and very clean with an amazing few (you could see all the way down to the water with a sunset view). We only stayed 2 nights and didn't end up using the kitchen amenities but there was everything you needed (coffee maker. toaster. oven. cooking utensils. etc.). It was a bit difficult to find at first - you should follow the written direction rather than using the map directions from using the address - but easy to get to once we got ourselves situated. Also ~5-10 minutes from downtown Rincon. steps beach. the lighthouse. and everything else you needed. I would definitely stay here again the next time I make a trip to PR!
43882738,Angel R,October,2020,awesome place and vibe

31959307,Ken,August,2022,Better than advertised and a great location for exploring Rincon. Only steps to great restaurants and a short walk to the beach. Friendly neighborhood.I found the place very clean and well-equipped for my needs and enjoied both outdoor sitting areas. The neighborhood is lively during the day and quiet at night.  The host is friendly and communicative. Will come again and hope this house is available!
31959307,Andrew,June,2022,The place is great very comfortable and in a perfect spot for beach. shops. and restaurant access. Tron is very responsive and helpful throughout check in process
31959307,Tom,May,2022,Tron accommodated my last minute booking. and let me check-in quickly and easily
31959307,Allyson,April,2022,Great location right in the heart of town. Easy access to town square. Quick response from the host. very helpful!
31959307,Christian,March,2022,Great location. great value. can walk to a ton of restaurants and bar.  Will be staying again.
31959307,Vicki,March,2022,Great. convenient place to stay in Rincon
31959307,Marlon,February,2022,Super good stay. If you're seeking location and chill look no further. Simple. quaint and perfect for access to the beaches and restaurants. There's a washing machine and dryer. The water temperature is decent too. Flex!
31959307,Kristina,February,2022,We booked our stay from 1/24-2/17. Tron was very responsive! I saw there was other reviews about water issues but we had none! There‚Äôs a good stock of supplies. which was super helpful and we added to. We had 6 people staying with us. 2 kids. 3 adults and 1 senior with MS who uses a walker on wheels and hiking poles to get around. The senior had this to say: ‚ÄúI liked how friendly everyone was around us (neighbors). The walk to the village was easy to get to. It wasn't to far up the road (hill) so walking was easier. It wasn't far to a beach.  It was a roomy place that we stayed at with everything we needed.‚Äù That being said we did have a car to help get the senior around too. One walk was enough in a day. There wasn‚Äôt any dishes to cook things in the oven. which would of super helpful when feeding a family. I did mention this to Tron. so hopefully some will be added. The a/c worked great! The front porch was nice to sit out on. The walk to and from the beach had plenty of places to stop for breakfast. lunch and dinner. if you eat out each meal. The fold up bed in the closet is comfortable. Very clean and organized space! Owned by a local Puerto Rican. which is always great to support! Farmers market on Sunday‚Äôs and Art Walk on Thursdays. If you‚Äôre use to a city setting this is a great location! If your use to a country setting. maybe not as long of a stay as I had.Show more
31959307,Nancy,January,2022,Tron's house is in a good location. Very clean and well equipped. Small. pleasant front porch. Tron is an excellent communicator. does all he can to accommodate. Unfortunately. Rincon has water supply issues. and we had to leave unexpectedly due to lack of water.
31959307,Joshua,November,2021,Perfect location for all your needs while visiting this little town. Close to everything and such a wonderful host!
31959307,Melody,November,2021,This place is in a great location. close to the beach. restaurants. and was very comfortable. A great spot to be staying to explore Rinc√≥n. Tron was extremely responsive and helpful! Would highly recommend.

31959307,Jack,August,2021,Place is in a great location. communication with host is very good. the space and the AC very comfortable. The place is just great.
31959307,Mac,July,2021,This space was great! The washer and dryer were extremely useful as we are beach travelers and Tron even provided detergent! The air conditioning was perfect and cooled the entire house within 10 minutes. We were able to walk to numerous restaurants and we even walked to the beach one day as well to watch the beautiful sunset
31959307,Roxanna,June,2021,The place is cozy. great location and clean. It has everything you need including some snacks. spices. water and kitchen tools.   Tron is super sweet. attentive and fexible.Hope to visit again!
31959307,Mandi,June,2021,This is a fab spot!!! So close to the downtown square. 10 steps from restaurants and pharmacy and cafes. About 5 min walk from playa Lala -  to the left or right find glorious beaches!!!! The A/C is super cold - internet works great - nice kitchen set up - quick communication- easy check-in. Lovely host & comfy spot with beach chairs. towels and cooler. Will stay again!!
31959307,Nigel,June,2021,The place is located half way on the hill on the right hand side so directions may be a bit confusing but not an issue. The host thought of everything to make your stay really comfortable. I mean EVERYTHING from Bottle water. frozen and canned food. spices. dishes. soap. shampoo etc.. You'll love this cozy place which is close to everything you'll need to be comfortable and have a blast. Food. grocery store. night life and beaches. This place is a MUST if you're looking for a quality and affordable place to stay. You won't be disappointed.
31959307,Christina,May,2021,My husband and I stayed here for two weeks and thoroughly enjoyed the place and atmosphere!! Nana‚Äôs place was perfect for walking to everything. including beaches. We are very grateful for Tron and his warm welcoming! We will definitely be back!!
31959307,Salena,May,2021,We stayed at Nana‚Äôs House for 6 weeks. It is in the middle of the town. if you‚Äôre not used to urban living this is not the place for you. There‚Äôs loud music. honking and street parking along the front with a narrow road. That being said. for us it was perfectly affordable. pet friendly and walkable if you don‚Äôt have a car and we were able to work from there. The internet can be slow at times. but to be expected considering PR is still recovering from hurricane Maria. Tron is a good host. while he gave us space. he left an abundance of starter food / bottled water and he offered to give us a ride to the grocery store. Will always cherish the time spent in Puerto Rico. Thank you Tron for the decently priced apartment to make it happen.
31959307,Sophie,March,2021,Excellent location!  You can walk to everything you need. And the house is much larger then I expected. It has two great little porches and and a sweet backyard as well. Wonderful host!  Would stay here again and again and again!
31959307,Scott,January,2021,Wow!!Suffice it to say that the pictures of the house don't truly do it justice!The location is unbeatable! You're literally 1/2 block from the square. and all of the restaurants and entertainment venues available there.Tron went out of his way so many times. whether it was to bring the boxes that we had shipped immediately upon their arrival. or to bring us homemade Coquito and rice pudding (it was Christmas. so I can't say that he will always do so).When we had to change our reservation from 2 to 1 month. Tron was a complete gentleman about it.Frankly. there's not one bad thing that I can say about Tron. or his lovely home here in the main square in beautiful Rinc√≥n!!
31959307,Jacob & Grace,September,2020,Tron was a great host. he was quick to answer any and all questions. The experience was very enjoyable!
31959307,Carla,August,2020,Great location. beautiful house and awesome host!!! Makes you feel like home! I had the best birthday weekend at Rincon!

31959307,B,February,2020,Nice size place. good a/c. great location in the middle of town; The one thing i did not like was the shower. There was no water pressure; also. when the heater is plugged in. the water gets too hot. so we ended up not using it and showering with cold water
31959307,Trevor,February,2020,Had to cancel due to some water damage. Which was unfortunate because the house has a convenient layout. and lots of space.Misael‚Äôs place is in a great location. close to bars/restaurants. the plaza and the beach. Neighbors are all very friendly.Misael is very responsive. Will add that the GPS pin/location is off. and more specific instructions would be helpful for getting there.

46918719,Rosa,October,2022,The beds were very comfortable and having the private pool. was a plus!
46918719,Tara,April,2022,Honestly. the outdoor space was the best part of this rental.  The rooms were basic. with only 1 TV per a unit. minimal kitchen/ shared indoor space.  We were fortunate it did not rain as much as forecasted. if it had. we would have been uncomfortable staying inside for long durations.
46918719,Lisa,April,2021,Pros -great service. covid secure. clean. great location. good outdoor spaceCons- inside needs maintenance and updating
46918719,Zulma Esther,March,2021,.
46918719,Carlos,March,2021,If you are english speaker this is perfect spot and Spanish speaker alike. My family of 9 and I had a blast here . The villa is perfect. I thought it was too good to be true when I first found but it was exactly as they describe and so beautiful the villa. I highly recommend it. We had plenty of privacy. and enough amenities to have a great vacation. Its just less than two min walk to the beach. The two staff that came by to make sure we were happy were awesome too. I know this seems like a long review but if I can book this location in the future for my family I will. Once you find the location and know where you are its very easy to get around. I give it a five start plus üòÅ. We had plenty of space for everyone. Super comfortable.
46918719,Catarina,March,2021,Nice and clean place! Recommended!
46918719,Heather,February,2021,This is a great location for multi families.  The staff was incredibly nice and attentive.  The accommodations are older so don‚Äôt expect pristine new bathrooms and kitchen spaces however. they are suitable for lots of people.  The pool was clean and well maintained and the outdoor space is perfect for kids.  The hotel restaurant. bar and pool were easily accessible to us.  The sunset view was perfect.  Honestly the hospitality of the staff outshines any minor complaints anyone could have.  Thank you! Truly a one of a kind place!
46918719,Carola,January,2021,The house/ apartments are part of the hotel and receive the same treatment a hotel room would. including pool maintenance and security check ups. Great location and great place for a vacation
46918719,Leatra,January,2021,Great place for our family to enjoy time together!  Super convenient location - close to downtown. the beach. great restaurants and stores.  Host was quick to respond when we had questions/concerns. it was nice to have the space of the house and also the convenience of the hotel.
46918719,Natalia,April,2022,Excellent place to spend a few days relaxing. Everything was as advertised. Communication was excellent.  The food at the restaurant was delicious and the prices very affordable. I would stay at the place again!Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

46918719,Emy,April,2021,Everything the real description says.  The location is perfect. The beach is a 1 or 2 minute walk. The kitchen has everything you need. The air conditioning and rooms are very good too. The terrace is super comfortable. many chairs. domino table. bathroom and shower outside. clean and large pool etc. The service I received since I started booking was excellent. It was the same service upon arrival at the Hotel. including security and who brought us to the house. It's a beach house. not a luxury house. One pays for privacy especially with the Pandemic we are experiencing. It has restaurants nearby (Cowboys and Pal 22 super rich) and the rest of a great hotel. I would stay there again.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

51905951,Lianne,May,2022,The location is convenient to spend all day at the beach. (I know it's not the host's fault but the condo has too many ridiculous restrictions) Bring toilet paper and garbage bags. we only had what they left. 1 per bathroom for a 4 day stay 3 nights. Hot water in a single bathroom ( the master). The exhaust fans in the bathrooms must be cleaned as soon as possible. they have so much dust that it can cause a fire.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

39837595,Adriana,April,2022,This property was so cute. Loved the rental unit which had everything we needed and a cute balcony with a table outside the room. The grounds have a jacuzzi with a pool on the way which was currently being built. There is a common area with a bar area and places to sit and socialize. The directions from the app are a little misleading. It took us to the wrong place however we just kept driving a little more and saw the big Blue serenity sign which is a helpful landmark. It is very close to the town. restaurants. shops and beaches. Highly recommend this rental!
39837595,Tyler,March,2022,Great place to stay. It‚Äôs a great location. Parking great. Rooms are clean. Amenities are perfect.
39837595,Jos√©,February,2022,No good
39837595,Sal,February,2022,Cute. clean suite in a nice guesthouse at a great location in Puntas. Short walk down to Sandy Beach. Jake's Java. Tamboo. etc. Just as advertised.The only negative is the frosted windows not letting any direct sunlight in and making the place feel a little claustrophobic.I'm guessing they are there due to construction? Hopefully they'll remove them eventually.

49689315,Lidzoe,May,2022,It is a nice place to stay in and spend time in Rinc√≥n. the view is excellent. and everything was very close by. The place overall has animals . more specific roosters. that would come and pass by to say hello. The neighbor is very nice‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôll give it a 10/10.

We would love to be back !
49689315,Hannah,March,2022,Great stay. as expected. Lovely view of the ocean from the private patio area. soft beds. clean and functional kitchen. Location was also good. just a short drive to the beach. If you're sensitive to animal noise. this might not be the place for you. as there are roosters living nearby who crow pretty late at night. but if you're sensitive to rooster noise. Rinc√≥n might not be the place for you in general.

The beds were comfy and we enjoyed lounging in the open living room/kitchen. in the outdoor dining area and on the hammocks. The pool and chaise loungers were the highlight! The pool was very clean and has a beautiful view. All the amenities - the parking space. the pool towels. the shampoo and soap in the bathrooms. the beach chairs and umbrella. fast internet - were much appreciated. The location is prime - just a short drive to so many lovely beaches. great restaurants. and coffee shops. Couldn't have asked for more. highly recommend this place!

The apartment is extremely specious and more than enough room for the 5 of us in my group. The pool was perfect and never crowded. I can‚Äôt say enough about our stay. local to everything. easy to get to . fast check in. and Allison was very responsive with any questions I had. The master bedroom in 6 overlooks the water it felt like magic every morning waking up. My group and I had an amazing time and we‚Äôre already planning our trip back !

35614469,A,December,2022,We rented this house for a three-family Christmas. and it was perfect for all. ages 6 months to 76. with plenty in between.  The house is extremely spacious with private areas to retire to when desired.  The place is abounding with bathrooms. which is fantastic.  The location is superb. with tons within walking distance (beaches. restaurants) and even more just a short drive away.  We made extremely good use of the kitchens and bbq and did a lot of cooking at home.  The place is very relaxed - a beach house vibe - and whatever was lacking in water pressure was more than made up for in view and a larger than expected pool.
35614469,Ana,November,2022,Great house and amazing location! Perfect for our family vacation! Can‚Äôt wait to go back.
35614469,Marko,August,2022,The stay was excellent - book this place.

35614469,Shelly,January,2022,it was a beautiful place. we loved the balconies they had great views and a nice place to relax. the power did go out on the last day and Dianna was right there with generators. the only thing we found was there was no extra garbage  bags and  limited  cleaning supplies to clean the grills and do dishes
35614469,Fabiola Cristina,December,2021,Loved our stay! The house was extremely accommodating for our family. and the location in Rinc√≥n was just perfect!
35614469,Alex,August,2021,The photos don‚Äôt do justice. The house feels very homey and comfortable. Plus. the condition of the house was excellent and clean.

35614469,Jeannette,June,2021,Perfect location for a vacation!  Dianna was very accommodating and pleasant. The property‚Ä¶.WOW!  You can stay in at the pool or walk to the beach.  Can‚Äôt wait to come back
35614469,Sydney,June,2021,This is a lovely and well maintained property.  A great wedding venue with the pavilion and surrounding villas.  A  great family gathering place for separate family needs for sleeping but gathering place at days end.  We rented the entire property through different  families and it was delightful.  There are alot of steps to get to the beach area.  I think about 157 from very top to very bottom!  Of course not all would have that amount of spreading out.  If you want a quaint area. a fun beach and a lovely property...this is the place.
35614469,Maria M,May,2021,Dianna your hous is beautiful and big. every part of the house is comfortable. and God blessed you for the place you constructed your house. Thanks again. Mar√≠a

35614469,Response from Dianna,October,2019,I am so happy you had a great time at Ocean View Paradise! Keep  us in mind for any future parties or events you may want to plan! Our event room can hold up to 75 guests and can accommodate  26 guests staying on the premises. Hope to see you again soon!Show more
35614469,Shana,September,2019,Dianna was a wonderful host. Even before we arrived. we had been in touch very often because there was potential for a hurricane. so we were on the phone every day as we decided if we had to cancel the trip. In the end we didn‚Äôt. but she was ready to be super flexible. Once we got the house was absolutely incredible and clean. and the pool absolutely divine. The property is incredible and very well stocked with anything that might be needed. It‚Äôs also a short walk to bars and the ocean. We had the greatest time and would 100% return if coming back to Rincon with a big group.

26590598,Kamil,August,2021,Apartment was pretty much as described.  The location was great. just a short walk from the beach. and it was easy to relax when we wanted to stay in. A few things could use an upgrade. like the showerheads and fridge. but overall. we liked our stay.

26590598,Eric,November,2020,The location is great. Only a few steps from the water and a few restaurants. Unfortunately. the water heater was hit or miss. If that gets fixed it is a perfect spot for a few days in Rincon.

26590598,MaRita,May,2019,Do not overlook this beautiful condo. Each bedroom is roomy and the master bedroom offers a private bathroom. We were fortunate enough to have the entire pool to ourselves the entire stay. The beach was a short walk away. We had an auto rental but chose the stroll to the beach and nearby restaurant. I did not notice it wasn't an iron mentioned in the amenities. We bought one and left it for future guest with the blow dryer. We also purchased wash clothes while there. Jennifer was a great host. Her response was quick for any questions. The WIFI was a little annoying. Each time my family of 5 left the home we would all receive text messages and voice mails.  We could connect to social media in the home but had to be on the balcony to use our cell phones. We are thinking of going in the fall and will definitely try to stay here.  This area is very close to the arts and crafts festival held in Rincon each Thursday and Sunday. and a supermarket and bakery are 10 minute drive away. Streets are narrow and curvy but we love the atmosphere. This place is also close to the Raphael Airport. It took us about 30 minutes to drive there. Have a good stay!
26590598,Response from Jennifer,May,2019,Hi! Thanks for staying with us! I realize our first message did not go through. but on the second you message us that you just wanted to let us know and we said thank you!  As we always tell our guest since the moment they book til they leave....we are always a phone call away!Show more
26590598,James,March,2019,Ocean Terrace 202 is clean. comfortable. and has everything you need.

26590598,Anthony,February,2019,The host canceled this reservation 317 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

20591859,Kyle,December,2022,Very nice place and great sunset views !
20591859,Cyre,December,2022,The apartment was very clean and in the perfect location. It was close to lots of restaurants/bars in Rincon. The view was stunning also. We loved hearing the roosters in the daytime & the coqui‚Äôs at night..So peaceful! The rooftop was the perfect place to relax and just take in the surroundings. The only thing that I didn‚Äôt love was the pool. It looked like the photos and it was well kept but it was pretty shady back there without sun which made the water too cold to swim in. A pool heater would be great!
20591859,Response from Jennifer,December,2022,Great to hear!

20591859,Christen,June,2022,We loved staying at Jennifer‚Äôs place! It is the perfect little getaway and plenty of space for multiple people.Only minutes from more than one beach - each with their own unique charm. Jennifer provided beach chairs. coolers. beach towels. sunscreen. etc. should we have needed it! We didn‚Äôt spend too much time at the place but we did really enjoy the private pool! It was ideal for a dip after the beach. The night lights and pool light were also a nice touch. Jennifer was communicative throughout our stay and I definitely would recommend her place to a friend and would even stay again myself!
20591859,Pedro,June,2022,More than I expected. Everything was excellent 100% recommended

Pool has nice light that changes color which was a fun touch. Perfect for a short or long stay. Two queen beds one twin. a futon and a couch. Perfect for a big group too!  Lots of storage space
20591859,Joshua,May,2022,This Airbnb was everything we could have asked for! Gorgeous place and so clean. Location is great and only a few minutes away from some amazing places and beaches to watch the sunset. The view from the rooftop was our absolute favorite thing. The pool was clean and very private.

This home had all the beach essentials and two queen sized bedrooms. I wish the kitchenett was a bit more to date but with so many restaurants close by it was fine. Again‚Ä¶ the pool was amazing.

20591859,Matthew,April,2021,Great place to stay and the private pool was a great touch!
20591859,Julia,April,2021,Good location-close to surfing beaches.  The pool was a nice feature-however- the cleaning woman and yard maintenance people disturbed the peace a bit.  Felt a little awkward laying by the pool when the yard guy was working.  Ran into a couple of maintenance issues with AC not working and ceiling dripping but those can be fixed.  Wish there were nicer outdoor areas/amenities-the rooftop could be improved.  The furniture in the living area was outdoor furniture and extremely uncomfortable. We traveled with our 10month old so having two rooms and the kitchenette came in very handy.
20591859,Rafael Jose,April,2021,The apartment is modern and comfortable. The pool is a plus! Only two observations. 1-The blinds in the bathroom was not only broken but dirty. 2- The pool filter only turns on a certain time of the day and then by the evening the pool seems a bit dingy. Overall a good stay!! Loved the peace and quiet!

20591859,Scott,February,2020,Fantastic place that is smack in middle of everything. Place was spotless and cozy!
20591859,Angela,February,2020,It was my second time staying at Tropical Suits (but in a different room) and was just as amazing as the last. Very thoughtful touches and just an incredible location. Would continue to book with them for future stays to the west.
20591859,Natalia,February,2020,It‚Äôs a great space! I wish I could‚Äôve stayed longer. Very private.
20591859,Response from Jennifer,February,2020,"Patricia only booked for one night. She called our office around midnight for extra bedding. She rented for 4 guests and our property has 2 queen size beds and a twin size bed with bedding. She wanted extra bedding and the housekeeper storage is right next to her unit. I gave her the access so she could enter but she was very irrational over the phone. saying she was not going to enter there and told us not to worry.  The storage is about 10 feet from the unit that she booked....  The next thing I know is she is calling the next day for a full refund. I told her I cannot give her a full refund over that and that I was going to give her a partial refund which we did the same day. She called 4 days after demanding more money and said this is something that she typically does when she stays at places. which includes threatening host for a full refund or a lengthy bad review. I chose the bad review as it is unfair what she is asking. We have plenty of other reviews that show the quality of our rental. 108 reviews with 4.7 stars to be exact. There is a lockbox at the property for guests to use it during their stay so they dont have to hang out to the beach with the keys so the key is always there and accessible. No guest has ever complained of a lack of lighting or ""not understanding"" the parking situation as is very straightforward.   This is the typical guest who wants to vacation for free.Show more"

20591859,Response from Jennifer,November,2019,Thanks for staying with us!
20591859,Zach,September,2019,Overall this suite is a great find. The rooms. living room. bathroom. and kitchen are very cute and clean with nice amenities (coffee maker. Netflix. beach supplies). The host provides a guide book that has amazing recommendations for local restaurants and shops. The roof deck and grilling area are very nice. open space. and a great place to relax (I loved the hammock). Be aware that this is a shared space with three neighbors  that also have access to all of these areas. including the pool. The pool was a nice spot to hang out. but it is much much smaller than it appears in the pictures. It is on a small 10x15ft deck and the pool itself is about 8x6ft and maybe 4ft deep. It‚Äôs cute. but the photos make it look way bigger. Also the property runs on solar power which is amazing! Very eco friendly and I appreciate that. It does cause occasional power outages. but they were very temporary and didn‚Äôt cause any harm or true inconvenience. I would definitely come back.

20591859,Response from Jennifer,May,2019,Anais. thanks for staying with us and I am glad our place and facilities were great. You never called us when this inconvenience happened and we saw your messages at 7 pm when the manager was already out and not in the area. As I tell guests if you have an issue call us for immediate response. If you would have called at 2 pm when this happened. my manager lives 2 minutes from the property and would have done the change. However. the guests were just 10 minutes in the wrong unit! I did messaged you we did not found your speaker and I send you the message :(Show more

Mattresses were very firm so if you don't like that. it might not be your thing. We would absolutely stay again!!! Awesome value.
20591859,Jose,October,2018,Super!
20591859,Response from Jennifer,October,2018,Amy. we understand our place may not be ideal for every family needs. however reading all before booking can save you lots of headache to make sure you can enjoy your vacations from day one with no surprises. First of all our property name is even Suites at 413 and the map shows the exact location prior to booking. If you are a repeat visitor you should know then that the main road in Puntas is 413. Second. the cancellation policy is clear at the moment you book however we kindly proceeded to give you a refund even though you were suppose to receive 0. All that was advertised was provided and we had to lose the opportunity of another rental because of yours. Regardless we offered $150.00 refund because we like to work things out with guests and we preferred them to move if they are not happy as we dont like unhappy guests. Again all was VERY CLEAR in our add. Hope you were able to enjoy in another location. Thanks.Show more
20591859,Rob,October,2018,Great place! I appreciated the local tips. beach towels. cleanliness. and the nice rooftop!

There was a little private terrace to sit on. as well as a shared roof top and little pool. which we had all to ourselves at night. There were also some fun board/cars games the host left for us. as well as a TV with free access to Netflix and WiFi! The beach is a very close drive. probably could walk. might take a little long though. Would stay again

20591859,Iliana,September,2017,This place was centrally located. I loved the fact it was in a quite neighborhood.The best part was the suite was loaded with AC and every fan in the house was really strong. The pool needed to be cleaned a bit more. so it can look more enticing to jump in.Other than that the property was in pretty good shape. Jennifer also provided an smooth check in. The house also brought nice thick showering towers and beach towels that we used.
20591859,Gabriela,September,2017,Jennifer's place is the perfect stay in Rinc√≥n. We were a group of 3 couples and each one had their own room. The location is perfect. close to restaurants and beaches. The apartment was very clean and had beach towels. a small kitchen. a tv with netflix. basically everything you need for a weekend getaway. Would definitely book again and will be recommending.

30319493,Antonio,July,2022,Nice place. very clean. fully equipped. all ac's worked great. short walk to the beach. A very  good value. Owners were also easy to reach. I truly and highly recommend this place.
30319493,Martha,May,2022,This place is clean. great atmosphere. nice touches. great location. We had a group of 22 using the house and apartments. A fantastic stay.
30319493,Antoinette,January,2022,My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Alan & Eileen's place.  The house is in a great location convenient to everything. They literally thought of everything that we would need to make our stay enjoyable.  The description and pictures are accurate.  I was in need of a private chef and although they didn't know any personally. they took the time to do the research and was able to provide me with some great contacts.  I definitely recommend the Beach Pad and we plan to stay there again on our next visit to Rincon.
30319493,Alex,December,2021,Amazing place and walkable to the beach. Extremely roomie for 8 adults to be comfortable sleeping and entertaining.Will rent again on additional trips to Rincon
30319493,Jason,November,2021,The Beach Pad is pure perfection! The layout of the rooms and the amenities are perfect especially for larger groups! Beds are extremely comfortable and the proximity to the beach is a huge plus. Having all the beach amenities and coolers available was very nice touch especially if you are visiting from the states.  I will definitely be going back and hopefully soon!
30319493,Ryan,November,2021,The beach pad is one of the best spots in Rincon. Have stayed a few times and would love to come back!
30319493,Kara,August,2021,My friends and I stayed here for a group nursing trip! The house was exactly as described- clean. nice. open units. Plenty of room for us all! We loved being a short walk to the beach and a bunch of local restaurants. I was especially impressed with Alan‚Äôs responsiveness when we had any questions or concerns. I would definitely recommend staying here!
30319493,Carlos,June,2021,The Beach Pad is a beautiful place and in a great location. They provide everything you might need for a beach vacation from towels. chairs. and coolers to a very detailed guide and even solar panels and a generator to deal with Puerto Rico‚Äôs fragile electric grid. The hosts are very attentive and respond quickly to any questions or issues you may have.  The beach that‚Äôs closest to the property was great and very calm during our stay.
30319493,Loraine,June,2021,Awesome home for the entire family!  We had an amazing time and were super comfortable!  The attention to detail did not go unnoticed. my family and I loved the surf/beach house!!
30319493,Dan,April,2021,The beach pad is a great location for large groups or small if you get one of the individual rooms. It was very clean and provided all the amenities needed for a beach vacation. such as chairs and towels. Alan was very responsive for any questions we had. and we had no complaints from our stay.
30319493,Noah,March,2021,Great place to stay! Awesome location. and Alan is a very helpful and responsive host.
30319493,Response from Alan And Eileen,February,2020,Thank you for the amazing review Michael! We were happy to host you and your group. We hope you come back to The Beach Pad soon!
30319493,Response from Alan And Eileen,November,2019,Thank you for the kind review Ariel! We hope to host you again soon.
30319493,Response from Alan And Eileen,July,2019,Thank you Carla! We loved hosting you and your family; you guys are excellent guests! We hope you come back to The Beach Pad soon.
24777187,Olga,September,2022,The place is oceanfront and is perfect for relaxing under the palms and enjoying the ocean breeze and stars at night.  It's close to restaurants. bars. and beaches.   Jim answered all my messages on time. Hope to stay there again.
24777187,Nicole,August,2022,Best location and best beach! We will be staying here every time we come back. Jim was so nice and accommodating. There outdoor space was incredible!
24777187,Henry,July,2022,Great place all around couldn‚Äôt complain about it.
24777187,Response from Jim,June,2022,Several of the ideas are excellent and will be implemented ASAP Daniela. This is our newest rental and not offered often.
24777187,Imara,June,2022,The place was exactly what I needed. Small with a magnificent courtyard with an amazing view. Communication with the host was excellent. Would definitely go back there again.
24777187,Katie,June,2022,Perfect little studio for a couple to enjoy Rincon!
24777187,Walter,June,2022,The water and beach were perfect. The backyard was great. Was blown away. Will definitely be coming back!
24777187,Response from Jim,May,2022,Always amigo. I stay in the studio a lot myself when I rent the Penthouse. Thanks for taking care of the place.
24777187,Willis,August,2021,If you are looking to relax. have  fun and  the  beach ..... super close.This is the Place.......  enjoy your getaway...... WOW.............
24777187,Susana,August,2021,Great location in rincon! This place has amazing views of the beach. Easy to get to. Enjoyed every bit of the beach. The grounds in which the unit is are great. There‚Äôs a shower to use after the beach and hammocks and lounge chairs for guests. Had a great time.
24777187,Yai,July,2021,Thanks for a spectacular place to clear your mind. It was what we need after a pandemic. Excellent place to relax. Excellent host. excellent landscape. in short. a paradise as if it were your home.
24777187,Jose,June,2021,The place is facing the sea. we stayed in studio H. but the air conditioning does not work well in the upper bed. they should put a fan in that area.  Carlos and his family were super nice.
24777187,Leyla,May,2021,This house has an awesome location and a chill vibe. Located directly on the beach with a private backyard with benches. hammocks. etc. We did not want to leave. I know some guests complain about the noise but we normally use a noise machine (whine noise) and it was okay for us. The only thing we heard was the guys next door celebrating and being loud but that‚Äôs not the owners/ manager‚Äôs fault. There is a lovely beach right in front of the house. another one within a 5 minute drive. Plethora of restaurants and breakfast & coffee places nearby. The only downside is a lack of a table space inside the room but it‚Äôs manageable since you can basically eat outside enjoying the views. 5 stars from me!
24777187,Juan,April,2021,This place was perfect! Just on Sandy beach and beside Tamboo. Walking distances to eat and drinks you don‚Äôt need to move your car for anything. Super clean. recommended 150%. Definitely will be going back to Jims place.
24777187,Max,March,2021,Right on one of the best beaches in Rinc√≥n. Close to food if you go during surf season. Older property. needs updating. Great hospitality.
24777187,Franceska,March,2021,Amazing view and location. great local recommendations.
24777187,Solimar,July,2020,Great place. pet friendly.  like it so much.
24777187,Hailey,March,2020,Pelican Point is located in a perfectly central spot for everything fun in Rincon. We had an amazing time in apartment H and found it to be the perfect hang out spot! Can‚Äôt beat the beach front views and spacious front yard. We will be back again!
24777187,Lucky,February,2020,If an unforgettable. magical time is what you're looking for. this is the place! The beach view is unforgettable. Everything is super clean and the location is perfect. Carlos gave us great tips on what to do and where we can eat. He is very welcoming and is such a wonderful host. He made sure our stay was comfortable and made us felt like we were at home. We will be coming back next time we visit Rincon! Thank you Carlos and Jim!
24777187,Stephanie,February,2020,Great spot:)
24777187,Coby,December,2019,This place is great! Right on the beach. walking to restaurants. with a fast acting AC. There‚Äôs a mini fridge. a heating unit on the shower head. and ample supplies (towels. cups. plates etc). I loved the restaurant right next door for a quick to-go drink and snacks on Sun-Thursday. The same place was a little bit of a nightmare on Friday and Saturday. Other reviews mention the noise but MAN. IS IT LOUD. They must bring in extra speakers or something. We ended up bailing a night early- but mostly because I couldn‚Äôt keep my kid there thru another sleepless night. A few years ago I would‚Äôve been in that bar til 2am and this complaint wouldn‚Äôt have happened. Ha!
24777187,Teddy,April,2019,Great little spot on the beach.  Short walk to the surf spot and restaurants and bars.  But please keep in mind the Tamboo gets noisy on Friday and Saturday til 2 AM.
24777187,Alex,April,2019,A comfortable place with excellent amenities except for the weekend music next door. Other than those few hours. it is well worth it.
24777187,Rachel,March,2019,This is a great little spot. Super conveniently located near Tamboo. pool bar. Casa Verde. Maria beach etc. everyone was always out in my neighborhood and we utilized the courtyard easily this way a couple times. Since it‚Äôs right on the water the waves act as a nice sound proofing so no one even heard us out there. When tamboo gets going it can be a bit loud (they already mention this in the listing) but nothing a decent pair of earplugs can‚Äôt fix. Worth it for everything else in my opinion. The unit itself is really cute. and has a little sleeping loft I didn‚Äôt know about when I reserved. Water is warm. and AC blasts if you want that. There‚Äôs also a sweet Roku tv. I didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing. Comes with Netflix and Hulu. hbo you have to sign in. All in all I recommend. I really enjoyed my stay :)
24777187,Jon,February,2019,My girlfriend and I stayed at Beachfront H over Presidents‚Äô Day weekend.  The Pelican Point property and the location definitely rate 5 stars. It is wonderful to walk out of the unit and basically step foot right onto the beach. The property definitely has that cool rincon vibe with hammocks everywhere and right next to Tamboo. The property manager. Carlos. was great and offered up some local tips for places to eat.   For the Beachfront H unit itself  I had to deduct a star as it it was pretty dark in the unit and there was no door to the bathroom just a curtain.  Overall I would definitely recommend and stay here again.
24777187,Jillian,January,2019,The location was great and I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the positive energy this place had to offer. Rinc√≤n was such a chill little place by the ocean. There‚Äôs nothing better than waking up to the ocean. and watching all the surfing was so entertaining.
24777187,Jose,July,2018,Nice place to stay great beaches excellent people
24777187,Timothy,July,2018,Place looks exactly like the photos. right on the beach! The room was clean and courtyard area was well kept. Hammocks and benches were great to watch the sunset. Carlos and Jim were excellent communicators. quick responses and had great recommendations. The tide was high so there wasn‚Äôt much beach area. but there were plenty of other beaches less than 5 minutes away. The only reason for 4/5 is the noise‚ÄîConstruction next door started at 6am. which we weren‚Äôt prepared for. Tamboo is right next door. it‚Äôs fun but definitely LOUD. If you‚Äôre down to party. this is the spot. If not. it‚Äôs still great‚Äî just be prepared to feel the bass until 2am.
24777187,Eduardo,July,2018,Very clean room. great location and great  value
24777187,Marceline,June,2018,This room was great and right on the beach. We fell asleep and woke up listening to the ocean each night. The yard was great for lounging in the hammocks or grilling with friends. There are two beds in this room. One is a loft. The community is adorable and has lots of personality. Right next door there is a great beach front restaurant. Food is good. fresh. and reasonably priced. We stayed over the weekend. At night the restaurant has a band or a DJ. We went over and enjoyed the music. Some nights it went until 2AM so if you need quiet to sleep. be advised. This was not a problem for us and was actually a bonus. The beach itself is more on the rustic/untouched side. We loved that. It was very natural and beautiful. Carlos as a host was welcoming. friendly and helpful. He gave us great suggestions on where to eat. We would highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back.
24777187,Omar,July,2018,Tks jim.. Everything is very cozy and accessible to the beachTranslated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
52385424,Ricardo,November,2022,We enjoyed the stay! Our party of 9 had plenty of room. and the place is just as described. Thanks a lot!!
52385424,Ivelisse,September,2022,Highly Recommended from a Wonderful stay.
52385424,Nicholas,August,2022,Logans house was amazing. Great location and wonderful set up. Just steps from beautiful Sandy Beach. His replies were extremely quick and detailed all while being very accomodating. The house is great for anyone traveling with a big group or two families. There was plenty of space for everyone. We would definitely look forward to staying here again.
52385424,Adlin,August,2022,This place was great. It was clean. accesible and spacious. We rented the three apartments for our party of 12. The pool was so big and we could all fit in at once and still have space to swim around. Very warm and private. The pool was serviced twice during our one week stay. There are trees all around and so there were many birds and friendly visitors. The seats on the pool are limited but our party was extra large. There is also an outdoor shower.Beds were comfy. lots of comfy sitting spaces. and well equipped kitchen. The cleaning crew was great and left cool towel animals on all the beds. which the kids loved.There are lots of stairs and slippery when wet. The driveway is a bit steep. Power went out a couple of times and it got hot. There is solar at the place and when I told the host he sent someone to turn it on. Puntas is very beautiful and a bit secluded. The beach was glorious and clean and a 3 minute walk. almost across the street. Most days we  had the beach almost to ourselves. A couple of restaurants walking distance and several others just a few minutes drive. All really excellent. There was a place to rent paddle boards too.Rincon is a special place and one of the most beautiful and safest places on the island. Not to miss. And Logan‚Äôs place was a great place to explore it from.Show more
52385424,Jose,July,2022,The place is exactly as showed in the pictures.  Nice pool area for a group. very private.  The beach is nice. more of a surfers beach. very clean and not crowded when we were there on a local holiday.  We had a good weekend at Logans place.
52385424,Emeric,July,2022,Almost paradise. The location can't be beat with walking distance to a world class beach that never had more than a dozen people present. The town was mere minutes of a drive. Aquada. Aquadilla. Mayaguez. Parquera all easy day trips.We split the entire place between three households within my family and it was perfect. Everyone had enough space and the pool was a welcome respite after a day of travels or lounging on the beach.The only negative I have to say was that we didn't have power the day we arrived. which led to the in unit AC unit beeping and blinking precisely every 22 seconds as the solar batteries attempted to kick on the immediately shut off. This prevented my from sleeping that night. That being said. that only happened that first night and the hosts sent out technicians to address the problem.Would I come back to Motel Rincon? Oh most definitely. The bottom unit is absolutely perfect for a couple.Show more
52385424,Andrea,July,2022,Great location. host was attentive. seamless check in and the house is great. spacious and with everything you might need.
52385424,Jeannette,July,2022,This vacation villa was amazing! The layout worked great for our family. The pool was great and. there was great Maintance service the wholeTime. We rented this villa after having a terrible experience with a other Airbnb we had reserved. Logan. the host was very prompt to reply and. made sure the villa was ready for us very fast after we communicated with him. He even refunded some money to us to make sure we did not pay too much over the amount we had paid for the previous reservation that did not go thru. I highly recommend this place and will keep in mind for our future vacations in Rinc√≥n!
52385424,William,July,2022,Great location and size. Nice pool layout. However we experienced many inconveniences with the property that were not resolved during our stay.
52385424,Jaclyn,June,2022,Place was great. Loved the layout of 3 separate places. We were traveling with extended family so it worked perfectly. Pool area is very lush and private. Loved that it was right off of the kitchen.  Also loved the small balconies off of the front of the house. A great place to read or watch the rain. Kitchens were well stocked. Beds were all very comfortable as were the couches. Bedrooms have air conditioners that work great. Oh and the house had amazing water pressure! Location can‚Äôt be beat. One block from beaches. restaurants and bars. But still set back away from any noise and crowds. The owners were great at getting back to us whenever we had questions or issues.  Communication was fast and helpful! Things to note Bring bug spray as there are mosquitoes by the pool. While we were there the 3rd floor did not have blinds or curtains in the windows.
52385424,Alex,June,2022,We had a great stay at the Morel Rincon. Logan was easy to communicate with and the house was just as described. We loved the proximity to the beach and how well equipped the house was for our large group. We‚Äôd love to return here in the future!
52385424,Pedro,June,2022,Great place for big families. Private pool and beach steps away. Everything was clean and organize. You have everything you need to have a wonderful stay. Highly recommended! Great host!
52385424,Janece,April,2022,This house is even better than the pictures reflect! If you‚Äôre familiar with the area you‚Äôll know this is a PRIME location and the hosts were incredibly communicative. We hope to revisit soon!!
52385424,Gabriel,March,2022,Perfect spot that‚Äôs a walking distance from several beaches. bars. and restaurants. Pool was kept clean (someone came every few days). tons of towels. beach chairs. and more provided.Overall great value and vibes
52385424,Ellys,March,2022,Beautiful place! We loved our stay!!
52385424,Doel,January,2022,Thank you for a smooth communication and a pleasant stay.
52385424,John,November,2021,Great place in sandy beach. Good location to beach. surf. and food!
11258275,Steven,October,2019,The best airbnb that I have ever stayed in. Cathy and Nevin went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was nothing less than perfect. The only thing that topped their hospitality was the actual home! Everything we needed was within a few minutes drive. We can‚Äôt wait to come back!
11258275,Liza,September,2019,We absolutely loved our stay at this little gem in Rinc√≥n!!Cathy & Nevin were perfect hosts! They gave us such a warm welcome to the apt. And gave us awesome tips on where to go and places to eat!The place was spotless and honestly is a hidden gem in Rinc√≥n. perfect for a couples get away! We slept amazingly well and waking up to nature was just so great! Cathy & Nevin were thoughtful enough to leave us some fruits and healthy bars to snack on and they even have a little coffee station equipped with coffee machine. cups. coffee. milk. sugar and everything you need. The kitchen is also fully equipped if you wanna cook while you‚Äôre there! We have absolutely no complaints about our stay we wanted to stay even longer! Perfect for a weekend to unwind or longer stay to relax and recharge batteries. When we were gonna leave Cathy & Nevin came to see us off and gave us such a warm goodbye! This will be our official place to stay in Rinc√≥n for sure!
11258275,Breanna,September,2019,Wonderful space. with great host! Will definitely be coming back soon. We loved being able to sleep with the windows and doors open!
11258275,Benjamin,March,2019,Cathy and Nevin's apartment is truly a magical place! The unit is recently renovated and nicely finished. Our favorite part was the wrap-around screened-in porch with sweeping views of the forest and the ocean! Cathy and Nevin were responsive throughout our stay. and a pleasure to communicate with. This will certainly be our new go-to Airbnb in Rincon!
11258275,Bay,February,2019,This studio is an absolute gem!  It is exactly as shown in the photos. beautiful and pristine with great amenities.  It's close to beaches. the town plaza and many restaurants.  The screened-in terrace was our favorite place to hang out with its view of the ocean and lovely breezes.The hosts. Cathy and Nevin. are the BEST hosts you can find anywhere.  Helpful in every way from start to finish. they exceed their desire to make the guests comfortable and to ensure that they have a great vacation.We had a wonderful time and already look forward to our next visit there.
11258275,Arturo,February,2019,I could not have chosen a better place to stay in Rincon PR. When I come back I will stay again with them. Everything was as described and they were very helpful with recommendations about things to see/do around town
11258275,Molly,January,2019,I‚Äôve been coming to Rincon for past 4 years and there is honestly no better place to stay than Cathy and Nevin‚Äôs. The photos don‚Äôt even do the space justice. And their hospitality is off the charts. I feel like I made two new friends. I‚Äôm fearful of writing too good of a review as I know they are likely to be booked solid for months!
11258275,Albert,January,2019,A great place to stay with your couple. the hospitality was  incredible Catherine and her husband are great people and very humble and lovely
11258275,Jonathan,January,2019,This place was overall excellent! The location. the hosts (Cathy and Nevin) was simply amazing and very kind with alot of local knowledge about the area. It was very romantic and relaxing. perfect for a weekend getaway or a longer stay. we just stayed 2 nights but if we could we would move in there :)
11258275,Chris,January,2019,Very kind and helpful hosts. The trek to the beach may be up and down a hill. but the overall beach atmosphere and the food/drinks make it worth it. Would stay again!
11258275,Joseph,December,2018,This place is a gem! Cathy and Nevin without a doubt enjoy making people happy. Their attention to detail and the fact that they are such amazing people adds a personal touch that makes you feel right at home. The place wows you right from the start. Not only is the place beautiful but it makes you feel like you are miles from civilization when in fact you are a rocks throw from beaches and restaurants. The view (specially at sunrise) is probably one of the most beautiful sights you will ever see (trust me it‚Äôs gorgeous)! this is one of those few places that you won‚Äôt want to leave to go back home from.
11258275,Eduardo,September,2018,Our experience in Cathy and Nevin's place was great. They received us at check in and recommended some local places to visit. The apartment has all you need if you want to cook or just staying in the place relaxing. Thanks for being so supportive with us and for making sure that we would enjoy our stay. Gracias!!
11258275,Ildefonso,August,2018,It is a PERFECT place to relax and enjoy the view. Very close (driving) to beautiful beaches. great restaurants and night live spots. Cathy and Nevin. you guys rock!!!!! Definitely we will be back!!!!
11258275,Humberto,April,2018,Great place. But the hosts are the best. Hard to describe because everything was perfect for me. I know there are cheaper options. but if you can spare the money its worth every penny. Would recommend this to anybody anyday
11258275,Justin,April,2018,Katherine & Ned were excellent host and their place was absolutely perfect! The studio was immaculate. stocked with all the basics (PLUS some). useful tips of the area. and beautiful views. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a romantic/peaceful stay.
11258275,Teo,April,2018,Cathy and Nevin are the best! Super clean apartment. very nice decor and the spectacular view. We'll be back very soon
11258275,Brianna,March,2018,Catherine and Nevin have put so much into their property. It‚Äôs a beautiful. modern place to stay. Just outside of Rincon away from all the noise but close enough to get everywhere easily. The space is smaller but they designed it so well. We stayed for a month and never had an issue with space. Plenty of storage and they offered great amenities. I would definitely recommend staying here!!
11258275,Kevin,March,2018,This place is outstanding.  Its tucked away on the edge of a jungle reserve with an amazing view and easy access to all the great surfing spots and local restaurants.  Cathy is super responsive for anything you need and will even provide you with some delicious coffee grounds so you start your morning right.
11258275,Response from Catherine,February,2018,A note on the guests' comments regarding animal noise. Yes. there are a lot of animals in Puerto Rico. and almost everywhere you go. you can hear some dogs and roosters. However. this apartment was designed with really good doors and windows. which can be closed at night. and an excellent inverter air-conditioner. so light sleepers can easily maintain a cool and quiet atmosphere.Show more
11258275,Mario,February,2018,Cathy and Nevin belong in the AirBnB Hall of Fame...seriously.  This place blew away my expectations.  They were ambassadors for the area of Rincon with their supreme hospitality. recommendations. communication. and impeccable cleanliness.Pros:  Literally everything.  Location. cleanliness. communication. attention to detail. recommendations. privacy. the list goes on and on.Cons:  Nothing.
11258275,Danielle,February,2018,Kathy and Nevin were amazing hosts. They were super easy to get a hold of and made sure to give us a tour of the Airbnb as well as give us places to eat and sites to visit. The view was absolutely amazing and waking up to the sunrise every morning with the windows open was the best. The apartment was super clean. If you like secluded places with amazing views but close to everything that makes Rincon amazing. this is the place for you!
11258275,Naari,January,2018,Simply wonderful! The apartment is very comfortable. clean and has many details that made our stay even better. The beach is near along with restruants. However. you are far enough to be in your own paradise. It was beautiful watching the rain over the rain forest from our deck in the morning. Cathy and her husband are excellent host! They went the extra mile to make our time in Rinc√≥n feel like home. We would without doubt stay here again! :)
11258275,John,December,2017,Catherine and Nevin were fantastic hosts. The northwest corner of Puerto Rico is one of my favorite places to surf anyway. and this new find of their Airbnb accommodation has just upped the game dramatically. The house is located nearly 1/2 way between the west side surf breaks and the north side near Sandy Beach and Antonio's. Their place has everything needed to cook your own meals and live large with great views and jungle canopy.  The accommodation contains restaurant and sightseeing information and the hosts' 15 years of local experience is invaluable for dining and other suggestions and recommendations. They know their stuff! Come to Rincon and help the locals beat Maria!
11258275,Lori,July,2017,Cathy and Nevin were awesome hosts. They communicated from the beginning and were available to us for anything and were very helpful.  The place was a perfect fit for us. The studio is a perfect size. the kitchen is fully equipped and the bed is super comfortable.  The atmosphere was so peaceful. We loved looking into the canopy of flame trees and lush forest.  Cathy and Nevin even lend us 2 beach chairs along with a cooler and great beach towels. which were extremely helpful. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet place that has all the comforts of home away from home.  I know we will return.
11258275,Jimmy,June,2017,Cathy and Nevin are great hosts; they respond quickly to guest questions and take the time to explain the best way to enjoy their little corner of Puerto Rico. This is a wonderful place to stay. and the town of Rincon has a lot to offer. If you are looking for a wonderful. scenic. and quiet place to spend your time. this is it!
11258275,Maxwell,April,2017,This was truly the most peaceful and scenic place I've stayed in Rincon
11258275,Cayleigh,April,2017,Beautiful views from the room. Cathy and Nevin were great hosts. very helpful with suggestions on things to see around town. Would definitely stay again!
11258275,Cilia,March,2017,Staying at Cathy and Nevin's apartment in Rincon was very comfortable and a very pleasant experience.  The pictures of the apartment posted on airbnb are a good representation of what it looks like.  It was very clean and the bed really comfortable.  They let us use their W&D.  The view and the jungle noises are fantastic and sitting on the screened porch reading a pleasure.  We never used the AC. due to a nice constant breeze.Our dealings with Cathy and Nevin were easy from the start till the end.  They gave us good driving directions to the apartment. where they met us to welcome us and where they gave us helpful tips on where to go and good places to eat.  We arrived after dark and the fridge was stocked with coffee. tea. sugar and half and half for our morning coffee and tea.Cathy and Nevin were always available via texting and were there to say goodbye when we left.The apartment is located on a hill in a quiet residential neighborhood and close to the Rincon beaches and many good restaurants.It was nice to have and we frequently used the cooler. beach towels and chairs provided.Cathy and Nevin are there to please! We will be back!Show more
11258275,Gregory,March,2017,First I want to say. if you are considering staying in Rincon. Cathy and Nevin are amazing hosts and you should absolutely choose to stay with them! They offered many recommendations for things to do and places to eat (there are amazing restaurants in Rincon. Green thumb was our favorite) and always offered a quick response for any questions we had. Communication with them was very easy and very pleasant. Cathy and Nevin are both very nice and up for a great conversation if you are looking for it.  Next. the space is incredible! Pictures don't do it justice. The screened in patio area is large and it's great for sitting outside and checking out the views. which are amazing! The king size bed is very comfy and the roku TV and wifi work great in the room. The kitchen is stocked with everything you could think of and Cathy and Nevin provide beach towels. chairs and a cooler for you to take on any adventure you want. The space is kept very clean and neat and overall is very luxurious. spacious and comfy. The doors and windows can all be left wide open due to the wrap-around screened in patio. so if you are looking for an open air experience this studio will not disappoint. Check in/check out was very flexible. My overall experience was great and my expectations were exceeded. Rincon is amazing. Cathy and Nevin are amazing. the room is amazing. Look no further. here is your future vacation. I will be back for another stay.Show more
11258275,Denise,March,2017,Very nice place. every detail is perfect.  Even though it is small. very well laid out and plenty of storage.  We cooked most of our food while there. and found the kitchen to be well equipped.  Comfy bed.  Great hot water.  The hosts are super nice and available to help with anything.
11258275,Jennifer,February,2017,My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay here!! It was so serene. The studio was beautiful. clean and modern with everything we needed to be comfortable. The wrap-around patio and ocean views were just so awesome. The patio is completely secured with a screen that prevented any bugs from getting in. so we were able to sleep with our front doors and windows wide open to the nice breeze and sounds of nature. Catherine and Nevin were such kind. gracious hosts that made us feel so welcome. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing. zen escape to paradise.
11258275,Bradley,February,2017,From the first contact with Cathy and Nevin we had a good feeling about this place. Once we arrived we were greeted at the street by the hosts and were pleasantly surprised to meet two amazingly kind and wonderful people. The condo is well above and beyond what the pictures show. The screened in porch is a bonus. We didn't turn the ac on and never closed the doors or windows. a true indoor/ outdoor experience with no bugs and a perfect breeze all day and night. We have been going to Rincon for 15 years now and this is by far the best space and value. If you are planning on Rincon book your stay with Cathy and Nevin you won't find better hosts or condo. Thank you again !
11258275,Paige,February,2017,Wow! Everything about Catherine & Nevins place was above and beyond our expectations. The pictures truly do not do it justice. The whole apartment is open and breezy. with the most amazing screened in porch. The beach chairs. cooler and towels really made our trip relaxing and stress free. We could also tell they really enjoy hosting. and were so enthusiastic about their town. They gave us awesome restaurant and beach recommendations. and even had a whole detailed binder of Rincon businesses! We honestly can't wait to visit again and bring friends. Such a wonderful trip.
11258275,Yuliya,February,2017,Catherine and Nevin are wonderful hosts. From the moment we arrived. they were friendly. welcoming. and warm. They were super responsive to any questions we had and made sure to share all of their insights about Rincon. The studio is GORGEOUS - amazing views. lovely breeze. clean and well decorated (with Catherine's own art!) and the king size bed is a dream. Can't wait to come back!
11258275,Mark,February,2017,We really enjoyed a 2-night stay here. Catherine and Nevin were very friendly. and went out of their way to greet us + recommend some local places to eat and hang out. The apartment itself was pretty amazing. even better than the pictures would suggest. The king bed was super comfortable. Wifi and Roku worked without any issues. which is not the norm in Rincon. Hope to stay again sometime.
11258275,Caroline,January,2017,Overall. everything about Cathy's place was amazing. Upon arrival. Cathy guided us on the phone directly to the apartment and was waiting for us outside. She and Nevin helped us park in the driveway (which was a bit tricky. but we got the hang of it!).The apartment itself is gorgeous. It is clearly newly-renovated and the decor is all modern and stylish. The bed is SUPER comfortable and big! The bathroom is beautiful. with great water pressure and very hot water. The screened porch is great because you can leave the doors open without worrying about bugs. The apartment is equipped with coffee and a coffee maker as well as tea. and Cathy left us with bagels and cream cheese. orange juice and well water for drinking. We loved drinking a cup of coffee/tea in the morning at the kitchen table!Communication with Cathy was excellent. She proactively reached out to us about refilling our water. providing extra soap. and letting us know when the power went out (briefly. and the generator turned on). When we had questions. Cathy called/texted with great answers. She helped us find a taxi for two nights (the taxi stand is right across the street!).Rincon itself is also amazing. Cathy and Nevin gave us great suggestions for beaches and restaurants. They provide a great house guide that gives guests instructions and suggestions for dinner. etc. Overall a great place to stay!!Show more
11258275,Lindsay,January,2017,Cathy and Nevin were wonderful. attentive and very thoughtful hosts! The condo itself is beautiful. clean. modern. and welcoming! We very much enjoyed sitting on the screened in wrap around porch. being able to listen to the ocean and marvel in the beautiful jungle/ocean surroundings. It's a short walk to the beach and short drive to all the beaches in Rincon. We enjoyed the relative longer walk to pool sushi which had a live band Friday night and surf videos steaming (drive in movie style). Highly recommend staying at Cathy and Nevins place!
11258275,Carole,January,2017,If you seek a peaceful and private refuge - close to but removed from the relative hubbub of Sandy Beach and Maria's - look no further. Spend your cocktail hours spotting iguanas in the treetops from your breezy. screened veranda and be serenaded each night by the coqui frogs. Everything is first-class: furniture. kitchenware. beach chairs & towels. right down to the perfect insulated travel tumblers for rum drinks on the beach.  If you're like us. you won't want to leave! Cathy and Nevin are thoughtful. helpful. consummate hosts who live a few doors down. Enjoy Rincon - it is. as another visitor shared. intoxicating!
11258275,Nicholas,November,2016,The space was exactly as described. Quiet. and good sunrise views. Cathy and Nevin were very accommodating and gave excellent recommendations.
11258275,Deirdre,August,2016,I can't speak highly enough of this apartment or of Cathy and Nevin. My partner and I booked the same day and they were able to quickly accommodate us. give us amazing directions on how to get there and meet us in the driveway to flag us down. They showed us around the apartment and the work they were doing on other properties. and gave us many many recommendations for what to do in beautiful Rincon. They are truly wonderful people! Easily the best experience we have had with AirBnB... the best hosts and the most amazing and relaxing spot. The apartment itself is beautiful. romantic. and spacious. especially for a studio; it had everything we needed! The apartment is modern and the view from the balcony is really as beautiful as it seems. This apartment is somehow a 5 minute drive from everything we wanted to see. and yet private and secluded next to a nature reserve. We will definitely be back! Thank you so much Cathy and Nevin!!
11258275,Janna,June,2016,We absolutely loved our time at Catherine & Nevin's place! They surprised us with an upgrade to their three-bedroom apartment. which was beautiful. The views of the surrounding jungle and ocean beyond were stunning. and it felt like we were perched on top of the trees. The apartment was immaculate and well-stocked; there were even breakfast foods and coffee waiting for us! There were beach towels and chairs. a cooler. and just about anything else we could need for a pleasurable and relaxing stay. The beds were king-sized and super comfortable. and each bedroom had a powerful air conditioner.   Cathy and Nevin met us at the apartment and gave us lots of helpful information. both about the apartment and Rincon (restaurants. places to visit. navigating). Anytime we had a question or needed a suggestion. Cathy was quick to respond via text (even when I had a late-night need!). They were incredibly gracious and delightful hosts. and we would not hesitate to stay with them again.
11258275,Ellie,April,2016,This beautiful jungle home was a highlight of our trip! When you look out from the screened porch all you can see is the lush beauty of Rincon and the surf.  You feel secluded yet it was only a 15 minute walk to the beach.  Everything in the studio is nice and clean! The bed is comfortable.  The manager Steve was cool and helpful.  The studio has everything you need for a night of cooking.  Nevin even brought us some herbs from the garden.  It is obvious that Cathy and Nevin are passionate about providing an exceptional experience.  So far our stay in Rincon was the best Airbnb experience I have had.  I can't say enough good things. I can't wait to go back!
11258275,Chris,April,2016,Cathy and Nevin are the best of host first of all. super sweet. Of the 3 places we stayed in P.R. this was easily our favorite and we had an expensive place right on Ashford in San Juan that wasn't even close. The bed was absolutely amazing. The water pressure and temp were excellent. Roku tv and wifi both work amazing and the screened in area was just perfect. You can enjoy the rain forest feel with everything open without any of the bugs! Just down the street is the water and an amazing little bar that we had a blast at called Tamboo. right on the water and cheap! I really could fo on. this is one of those rare really great experiences where everything exceeded expectations. Thanks again guys. we will definitely stay here again if and when we return!
11258275,Louise,April,2016,The place was amazing! They were very attentive and responsive to all the needs we had since the start.The photos do not do it justice and the views are breathtaking. The place was super cleaned. organized and it had all the basic supplies that you need for a great stay. I will definitely be coming back and recommend it.
11258275,Shruthi,March,2016,Cathy and Nevin were amazing hosts at this incredibly cute apartment with breathtaking views. Cathy was super responsive to the many questions I had even before I booked the place. Cathy provided detailed directions to the apartment from San Juan. Nevin and Cathy warmly welcomed us on our arrival and provided a detailed list of restaurants and things to do around the area.   The photos of the apartment online don't do justice to this tasteful built treehouse overlooking the a dense rainforest and the ocean. You can leave the French glass doors open all day to watch the gorgeous sunrise in the morning and fall asleep to the sound coquis at night.   I wish we had more time to spend in this amazing house! Will definitely be going back :)
11258275,K,March,2016,One of the most relaxing vacations in years.  Cathy and Nevin were such wonderful hosts. really going above and beyond all expectations.   Our travel plans getting to Rincon where delayed. but they were so flexible and kind on our arrival. we felt right at home.    They provided a private location for parking the car. than lead us down a short. scenic path. leading to the rental.    The rental was the perfect size for a couple. the pictures really don't do it justice.  It has two full sides of screens. that allow for beautiful forrest and water views without the bugs.  We left the windows open the entire week. and loved the breeze coming through the place.  A lovely king size bed. new bathroom and great kitchen/dining space.  We were so comfortable we actually spent one whole day of the trip inside. watching Netflix.   They very kindly provided bath/beach towels. a cooler. dish/bath soap. all the cooking items you could need and fresh flowers.  Knowing we landed early. they even provided coffee for us to reenergize.     The location is set back from the road. so it feels very secluded. but is a short walk or drive to multiple beaches and resturants. The town is absolutely adorable and perfect for exploring.   We were provided a sneak peek into another unit they are currently developing. and it was also really beautiful-- with all the same sweet touches.  We will 100% be back. and look forward to staying with Cathy and Nevin again.  Show more
11258275,Response from Catherine,February,2016,Hello Mike and Kara! We hope that your trip home was smooth. and uneventful.  Thank you so much for reviewing your stay with us in Rincon. in such detail. Input from guests is certainly important. As we said in our review. you both were the perfect guests to have!

619569283276567936,Jesus,December,2022,Excellent and good communication with the host
619569283276567936,Sarah,December,2022,We liked our stay but felt it was not worth the money. Unfortunately. we were expecting more privacy based on the photos and description but instead had our private bath facing a neighbors home and windows from another unit looking down onto the private bath and private pool.There were issues with our fridge being broken and the pool light flashing. While the owner was responsive in trying to fix these. we did not want to waste our vacation time having to sort this out and felt for the price. everything should have been thoroughly checked and updated before we arrived so we didn‚Äôt have these issues. Overall. our experience was fine but we were expecting a higher quality stay.

34746037,Luke,November,2022,We enjoyed our stay very much. the apartment has wonderful views and is walkable to the beach and restaurants.
34746037,Zoraida,August,2022,This place was disappointing and we made the best of it.  The pool and view is the only highlight.  The pictures that are posted and amenities are not accurate.You have to pay for washing and drying. no air in living/dining room.  scarce amount of beach towels and beach chairs are few and old.  Patio furniture is broken.  Appliances need updating.  Wi-Fi kept coming on and off and we needed it for work.
34746037,Erin,April,2022,Perfect location in Puntas and Suleym was super responsive and helpful. Can‚Äôt beat the view from the balcony.
34746037,Chris,March,2022,great place. great location. very responsive host.
34746037,Matt,February,2022,Great location and highly responsive host that is willing to help you with anything you should need! Comes stocked with beach chairs and towels and some other useful stuff that you will be happy to have during your stay!
34746037,Foli,February,2022,Perfect location. Great views. Pool was great.  just plan on that in the morning when the sun is on that side. Space was great and plenty of room. Stocked with everything we needed. Beach chairs. towels. umbrella. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
34746037,David,February,2022,We had a great time at this place due to its view and location. The advertisement is accurate but our stay would‚Äôve been even better if some repairs to this unit were done. Some window blinds and ceiling fans/lights and furniture are in need of repair or replacement.
34746037,Mackenzie,February,2022,Great location! Nice apartment. had almost everything we needed for our trip to Rincon.
34746037,Margaret,February,2022,We enjoyed our stay at puntas villas and would rent again. The directions to the apartment are unclear so figure that out before hand.  We traveled in at night and had trouble. Puntas is a cute town and there are plenty of places to eat and beach. The view and pool at this apartment are primo.
34746037,Joshua,January,2022,Two of stayed here for 5 nights.  Check-in and communication was easy. Location is very good for Sandy Beach. it's like a 5-minute walk to the beach.I had a few issues with the place. First. the apartment doors lock & unlock only with a key. That means that if one person leaves and wants to take the keys.  the other person is locked inside. Second. there is only a single set of keys provided. so managing keys is inconvenient. Also. the building has a number of locks to get in & out that similarly requires keys to lock.The second main issue I had is there is a lot of deferred maintenance in the unit. The comforter on the twin beds desperately needs to be washed. The AC compressor unit makes a periodic rattling sound that is disruptive during the night. At least one of the blinds won't stay up on it's own and one of the windows won't close all the way. The bathroom door knob is loose. Oh and the light pull-chain on the master bedroom fan doesn't work.Note this unit does not have backup power in case of a power outage. We had a 10-hour outage during the day one day.Show more
34746037,Shayla,January,2022,It was a nice place with a good location. Well stocked kitchen and beach supplies. However it was lacking in basic supplies such as toilet paper. trash bags. detergent. and paper towels. Be aware that there are tons of gates that can be difficult to unlock but that make it secure. Very close to beaches and good restaurants. Overall enjoyed our stay.
34746037,Keith,January,2022,This apartment is certainly serviceable.  Nothing great but nothing too horrible either. Two of the 3 beds we found hard and uncomfortable. The pool is nice.  Didn‚Äôt receive full check in instructions until we were on our way from San Juan and sent a message to request them. The response came quickly with the directions. We never met or saw we talked on the phone with anyone related to the apartment. just followed instructions for checking in and left.
34746037,Will,December,2021,5 stars across the board - a cute unit with a lovely view
34746037,Janet,November,2021,First. the view its spectacular and the sound of the waves are the best therapy for a good night sleep after a long day at the beach. To get in the apartment. expect two floors of stairs. The pool was clean and pretty much empty all the time. *The patio furniture its old. rusty and some broken. There are more apartments around in the same building. The apartment overall was OK. for me a little bit pricey for what it was.
34746037,Alicia,September,2021,Just like the pictures.
34746037,Jen,August,2021,We loved our stay here. Beautiful view and a quick walk to Sandy beach. Kitchen was fully equipped and a lot of things were provided to take to the beach. I would love to come back and stay again.
34746037,Lilia,August,2021,This is a great place much better than the pictures!
34746037,Tricia,August,2021,Great space. clean. close to the beach. Set up with supplies for the beach and to cook at home. If the power goes out in the neighborhood. we enjoyed the patio with flashlights and cards. we found a spot open for food. Our host was immediate with responses of questions and supplied a current book with all excursions to choose from. Would book with this host again.
34746037,Joshua,July,2021,great space and location! beach supplies are provided. which helps make the experience that much easier and pleasant. everything you need for cooking is available. when driving just be mindful of the hill steepness and take it super slow upon entering the property if your renting a sedan (rent a jeep if u can). lovely view off balcony and the sound of the coqui are enchanting.  not much going on in the immediate  area at night (tamboo was not open) so head to rincon plaza or the beachouse for somenightlife activity. overall a lovely time!
34746037,Sandra,July,2021,The apartment was super comfortable and had an amazing view from the balcony: green and blue all around. The pool was clean. refreshing. and always open. We had it mostly to ourselves. The apartment is about a block and a half from Sandy Beach. down the hill. where I took long walks every morning and you could take surf lessons. Some people swim there but locals recommended Tia Lala for swimming since it has smaller waves (10 min south. driving). we spent an amazing day at the beach there. We also went paddle boarding in A√±azco (20 min south). Amazing sunset! Highly recommend renting a car to get around Rinc√≥n and neighboring towns/beaches. Restaurants in the area are Ok but a bit overpriced for the food so we were glad we had a kitchen to cook some nights and could go out to eat at a more local restaurant in Aguada. There is a well stocked supermarket (Econo) 10 min south driving; on the block before the supermarket. there is a recycling plant where you can drop off your plastic before you leave. All in all. we would stay here again! Gracias!
34746037,Jackson,June,2021,Great location with a beautiful home and scenery. Would recommend 100% and hope to return soon!
34746037,Emily,May,2021,Great stay! The location is awesome for walkability to Sandy Beach and some great local restaurants. The balcony view is beautiful and we loved the mural in the living room!
34746037,Susan,May,2021,Loved staying at this colorful condo in Puntas! It is perfectly located (close to restaurants. beaches. and a short drive to Rinc√≥n). and is also quiet. spacious. and has a lovely balcony with a hammock that we enjoyed in the late afternoons. The pool and private parking are also a plus! Would stay again :)
34746037,Gretchen,May,2021,Great place! Clean. quiet and great location.
34746037,Zaiska,April,2021,We had a great time. This is a multi-unit complex within walking distance from several beaches and places to eat. It is a popular spot with other vacation apartments nearby. Well equipped apartment. Check-in and check-out were very easy.
34746037,Alvaro,April,2021,great location for surfing with a nice view
34746037,Ryan,March,2021,Our stay was great and would definitely recommend. The location is amazing and right next to restaurants and beaches. The pool was a great add and the place offered extra stuff for us to use for our stay (beach chairs. umbrellas.. etc) the balcony was the best part and the view was great. One thing to add is there were some power outages in the building for us but it did not ruin the trip and it is very normal for the area but just a thing to keep an eye out if you need power at all times. But not something to deter you away from this great option to stay. Will absolutely be back and stay here!! 10/10 would recommend to a friend
34746037,Piero,March,2021,amazing stay!
34746037,Jorge,March,2021,Excellent place with great views.
34746037,Katherine,February,2021,This was a beautiful place to stay. well stocked. great views. very responsive hosts . great location. safe and comfortable! I hope to get to stay there again sometime
34746037,Juan,February,2021,Very nice place and close to a lot of great local spots. The host was very responsible and quick to respond
34746037,This place is a paradise. such a great view and location and we had a fantastic experience with the host for checkin and check out. We visited friends nearby and other parts of the island don‚Äôt have an easy access to the beach like this place does. It‚Äôs also considered one of the best beaches on the island so if that‚Äôs what your trip is for then this is the right place for you!! Also. they have a bunch of beach stuff there like chairs and umbrella which is a nice touch. The place was a little hard to find on GPS and we had to FaceTime the host to arrive. but they were incredibly helpful and made sure we found our way.  The only note I would add is that we couldn‚Äôt get the tv to work and it was a little lacking in basic house stuff like TP and extra trash bags. For us we made do and didn‚Äôt want to watch tv anyway. I think,January,2021,is a pretty slow time so perhaps at other times it‚Äôs fully stocked.Thanks so much for the stay we hope to come back!Show more

34746037,Orlando,June,2020,Excelent apartment for a family or friends trip. Amazing view!!
34746037,John,February,2020,Great Location. central and walkable to everything at Sandy Beach.  The condo is very secure. with locked gates at all access points.  Nice view from the balcony.  Saw a whale one day off in the distance.  Also saw a monkey walking along the neighbors wall across the valley.  Which is apparently extremely rare!  The nearby local bars can get a little loud on the weekends. but the AC units helped drown out the noise.  Thanks again to Brian and Suleym!
34746037,Crystal,January,2020,Brian's place was nice the pool is beautiful and the view of apartment is beautiful and close to the beach! Very clean the host was very quick to respond unfortunately we had to leave before expected due to the earthquake and the area being without electric and water but that was also most of the island and Brian and his host also went out of the way to accommodate us best they could I would definitely reccomend Brian's place!
34746037,James,January,2020,Great location and space. It has a beautiful balcony with ocean view. The location comes with beach stuff (chairs. umbrella. etc) and had everything needed for a great stay. The only minor inconvenience is that it is so close to fun spots (Kahuna bar. Tamboo) it can be a little noisy late at night. Overall through. an excell
34746037,Maria,December,2019,Our stay was great! The views were incredible from our balcony. Pool was nice. Apartment was clean & had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Brian & Suylem were very accommodating & quick response time. Will definitely come back again next year!
34746037,Shannon,November,2019,The charming little guest apartment is secure with plenty of locks so we felt safe. The neighbors in the building were all friendly and took the time to say hello. The pool area is lovely and we appreciated having it for our 6 year old daughter. The driveway is super super steep- we loved it because it made us laugh each time we had to accelerate our little rental car up the hill! We had a great time using this spot as our crash pad in between snorkeling. sailing. surfing. and eating!
34746037,Stayed for this summer (,July,2022,) Communication with the host and the location of the place is excellent BUT WATCH OUT! 1) The cleanliness of the accommodation is terrible. understood: screens with too much dust. dusty curtains. dining table (BROKEN). bathroom curtains with mold. dirty flooring with dust and dirt. 2) There was no necessary supply of items such as: (CLEAN towels. sheets. toilet paper). 3) The light goes out COMPLETELY on your second day of stay. so you would be without LIGHT and without LIGHT generator your last two days. 4) the PRICE is too much for a place in good condition (unpleasant. dirty and unattended). I don't recommend it for ANYONE.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

34746037,Glorimar,June,2021,The place is like and nice. we felt safe. unfortunately and as everything is currently in Puerto Rico the first day there was no electricity and the place had no generator. the other thing I noticed is that the pool the administration does not give it maintenance and it is something that another guest had already mentioned I thought the host had known that the situation was still the same. You can walk to the beach and restaurants but the pool was a plus for the last day to rest and enjoy the apartment. The host was friendly and understandingTranslated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

Well-stocked. pretty kitchen lacking only a dishwasher (not that I needed it). Victor responded very quickly to questions about the door code and finding the house. I would happily stay there again.
10448357,Chad,July,2021,Great place within a short drive (2-3 min) of Sandy Beach.  Host was extremely communicative and helpful.  There was a slight issue with electricity at the beginning of our stay. due to a passing hurricane. and the host stayed in touch the entire time and bought us a very nice meal. even. to make it up to us.  Would stay there again. for sure!
10448357,Walter,June,2021,Rinc√≥n is amazing. great surfing and fishing. Nice community and everything you need to enjoy your stay. Victor was available always.

10448357,Gal,July,2017,The best man in Puerto Rico is Victor. Amazing host.
10448357,Ash,July,2017,The host is very responsive. professional. and easy to work with. This place is great. modern. and spacious. Very clean! The neighbors are wonderful. too. In a quiet little neighborhod sourrounded by palm trees and the ocean. The town of Ric√≥n and it's people are fantastic. There's so much to do so close to this home. The beach is a 10 minute walk down the hill and visible from the house kitchen/common area! Food and entertainment (music. farmer's market. snorkeling. surfing. boating. etc.) are a 5-10 minute drive away. If I come back to PR (I will). I'll be staying here if this place is available!!
10448357,Bill,February,2017,Victor is an amazing host and his house is in an ideal location for visiting rinc√≥n! We locked our keys in the house and Victor drove half an hour to rescue us! The house was clean and slept out family of 5 comfortably. Walk to the beach. yoga and restaurants. Short drive to anywhere in rinc√≥n. We will be back!
10448357,Dora,January,2017,The house is located in a quiet area with a nice view. The house was comfortable. clean and with all the amenities you need to have a nice time. We found everything we needed. The place is close to restaurants. bars and the beach. You will need a car to explore better the area. The host was great! Victor was always available to answer questions. give suggestions etc. He promptly resolve a little inconvenient with the BBQ. He occasionally checked-in with us to make sure we were enjoying our time. He even left a welcom gift. we love the place. and very thankful for Victor's hospitality. He was attentive to all of our needs.
10448357,Andrew,December,2016,Victor's house is exactly as pictured and suited us very well for our stay in Rincon. It is a short walk from Sandy beach. but at the same time a little secluded from the main street. We liked the view. the backyard (BBQ included). the accordion-style doors. the kitchen. and the bedrooms/bathrooms. We had 4 people. a baby. and 2 dogs and it was perfect. We were able to explore the west side of the island and at the same time grill out on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. We HIGHLY recommend Victor's place if you have a family (the bunk beds in the one room are double beds so extra roomy!). have dogs since it is pet friendly. and love to surf as your location is walking distance to Sandy beach and a very close drive to Maria's. Domes. and Steps. One note is that the yard is not completely fenced in. Also. Victor was very helpful when we got a little lost finding the place. Have him send you a google map of the house since it is so new it hasn't been updated on google maps. Once you find it you realize how easy it is to get to. Drew & Brooke
10448357,Elvin,July,2016,The house was amazing. it had a vibe that made you feel right at home. Equipped with all the amenities imaginable. Highly recommend it and definitely going back.
10448357,Manuel,July,2016,Excellent location and neighborhood! The house was very clean and well maintained. Victor was very kind and flexible. Will stay again!
10448357,Wilma,April,2016,Victor's house was perfect for the weekend. Near the beach and fun places. Everything was brand new and clean. He was always available and responded to questions quickly. I will stay on Victor's house again. Thanks Victor!
10448357,Response from Victor,March,2016,Thanks Steven.  It was a pleasure to host you and your family in our home . I hope to see you again.
10448357,Brendan,March,2016,Victor kept close communication with me leading up to the stay. This made for a less stress environment where there was no surprises when we all arrived.

9919579,Response from Serenity,June,2022,We are stunned! we have been successfully hosting this place for 6 years.  There is some wear and tear. but the way this review was written it's carrying bad intentions. lies. and it was hugely exaggerated. We wonder why his full name is not posted on this site and why we never saw them leaving or entering the apartment.  We were never told about any discomforts even though we are on site all day long and reception is on the way out.  However. they did communicate their inconveniences to locals.  I was born and raise in this town and people are not in the habit of talking about businesses or people in negative ways. it is not our vibe.  The pictures of this room were taken are true to the room.  We have a pool under construction (not finished).  We have a small pool is in a common area. not a hot tub.  We are located in a very rural area in a tropical island. there are bugs. There is an honest. detailed description of this room. property. surroundings. etc. on this site. So that you are making an informed decision at the time of booking.  This apartment has a full kitchen. it's Ocean View. it has 2 private bathrooms and 2 private balconies. it covers the space of almost the entire 2nd floor of our building. with a dinning table with 6 chairs. and a living room as big as 2 standard rooms.  Prices change according to seasons. holidays. etc. We believe it's way more comfortable than a hammock on the beach :)Show more
9919579,Katlyn,March,2022,Serenity is good! For the area. I feel like this property is on par. It‚Äôs clean enough to feel comfortable sleeping and let‚Äôs be honest - you don‚Äôt come to Rincon to sit in your room anyway! The separate rooms and bathrooms are nice for groups and the apartment itself is huge. plenty of room to store surfboards. and beach equipment. It‚Äôs walking distance to Sandy Beach if you don‚Äôt mind the uphill trek back as well as close to Casa Verde Bar and 2 coffee/a√ßa√≠ bowl cafes!

9919579,Jenna,March,2016,Great room! Exactly as described. Sara was very accommodating and friendly! Look forward to staying here again in the future. Great location near Sandy Beach.
9919579,Jose,February,2016,The listing for Apt #10 was more than accurate. The apt. was huge with a panoramic view of the ocean. The living room had three sofas and a well equipped kitchen. Needed a coffee pot though.  The two bedrooms both had views of the ocean from their balconies and each had on suite full bathrooms. plus a 3rd full bathroom. just off the kitchen area. Great acomodations.
9919579,Leslierl,February,2016,Sara was a great host. she was so kind and attentive. Me and some friends stayed for valentines weekend. and we can't  be more happier with have chosen to stay in Serenity. The place is perfect. Tamboo. Sandy Beach and different eating places walking distance. I will definitely be back soon. Thanks Sara!
9919579,Ann,February,2016,Host was present but did not welcome us upon arrival or show us around. She did allow us an early check in which was appreciated. The place was very nice. modern. clean. open and airy.  Host should leave a broom or swiffer pads. as there is no way to clean up the floors during the stay.  Close to beach and beautiful jacuzzi and deck.  Definitely liked it. but felt quite uncomfortable around the host.
9919579,Alexis,January,2016,Serenity is stunning. Location is superb. walking distance to the beach. surf. bars and restaurants. and at the same time a very quite place to relax. Everything is brand new. very clean and kept together. Beds were amazing. I could go on and one but you have to check it out yourself.
9919579,Siomara,December,2015,Fabulous experience! We left kicking and screaming. Everything was new and clean. They let us borrow beach towels. had fresh coffee every morning. and answered every question right away. Walking distance to fun bars and the beach. The a/c worked great and the grounds were beautiful.....including a clean. private hot tub. It was peaceful and quiet and absolutely beautiful! We did not feel like we were being baby sat or monitored at all :)
9919579,Kimberly,December,2015,Serenity is a 3 minute walk to the beach. and is close to cool surf shops. and eateries.    Our host was very accommodating and super responsive to our emails.  We were welcomed upon arrival. and any question or request we had during our stay was answered to.    The property itself is very clean. new. and private.  We felt like we were in a serene oasis so the name is quite fitting.  I would certainly recommend this place to my friends/family if you are looking for a nice place to stay on the West Coast of the Island.
9919579,Julio,July,2022,Everything as described. Spacious and comfortable spaces. Comfortable and clean beds. Spacious bathrooms. Excellent service and communication.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

9919579,Edgardo,September,2020,Beautiful and cozy place in the corner . close to beaches. picturesque village and beautiful people. It is a place of relaxation and connection with nature. I recommend it 100%.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
9919579,Glianeicha,August,2020,Everything is excellent!!!! They treat you very well and the place is spectacular.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
9919579,Arleen,December,2019,The place is very cute and comfortable. However. even though the bed was big. it had only a small frieze (for kids). Also the pillows were in poor condition (dirty) as were two towels. The communication with the person in charge was good and responded appropriately to what we requested. Overall we had a great time and I understand that if those small details are improved it would be a perfect place.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
9919579,Mariola,May,2016,"We stayed in the apartment. It was much bigger and more comfortable than we expected. We loved everything about the stay. Comfortable rooms with clean and remodeled bathrooms. The view of the master bedroom is perfect. We liked that it's ""pet friendly"". We'll probably be back.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original"
49529927,Jeffrey,December,2022,Stayed Here a couple times now. I luv the location. The front curtains are sheer. so had to put a towel above the door.  Bedroom Curtains aren‚Äôt black out so it get light very early.  The swinging bed (suspended from ceiling ) was very mobile.  I stayed here before so I knew about it.  Not all the units r like that so u should ask - it‚Äôs quite odd.  Host was 1 step of everything perfectly
49529927,Jamie,October,2022,Cute place near the beach. We really appreciate the beach chairs. umbrella. and towels for our trip to steps beach. We had a great stay here! Allison and her team we very accommodating and awesome!
49529927,Marah,September,2022,Loved it! Second time staying at RSC and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Loved the decor. location and easy accesibility in terms of parking and check-in. Allison was lovely. kept in touch before booking to answer any questions and was able to provide early check-in.
49529927,Samantha,July,2022,Very good communication with Host
49529927,Melanie,July,2022,Always a pleasure to stay at any of Allison‚Äôs places. Communication is A+ and the accommodations are always exactly what you‚Äôd expect.
49529927,Hilda,June,2022,Always awesome!! Thanks so much!!
49529927,Joelito,June,2022,Aliisome is the best!! She was super attentive!!
49529927,Luis R,May,2022,Great location right at Puntas. Rinc√≥n. We loved it! Excellent and well maintained property.
49529927,Ana,May,2022,Perfect spot in Rincon. clean and spacious enough for 2-3 persons. And a parking spot right next to the room.
49529927,James,May,2022,Great spot
49529927,Alicia L.,April,2022,Lovely place to stay. close to good restaurants and landmarks. Would definitely stay again.
49529927,Bunny,April,2022,Great place. Highly recommend
49529927,Francisco J.,March,2022,Great property! Parking on premises. clean. a nice kitchen and near everything (a surf shop. restaurants. beaches. etc.). definitely a very nice place to stay.!
49529927,Toby,February,2022,Wonderful
49529927,Jeffrey,January,2022,Great location- less then 1/2 mi walk to beach house (bar/restaurant) for sunsets every night n less the 3/4mi to Maria‚Äôs surf break!!
49529927,Claudia,January,2022,Centrally located. minimalist. good spot to explore the Rincon area.
49529927,Saul,November,2021,Rincon Surf Club is a great place. The vibe is amazing. Allison is so pleasant to work with and very understanding. and everything in the apartments worked perfectly. Views are magnificent. d√©cor is cool and laid back. and the units have the perfect amount of space. Would definitely recommend.
49529927,Manuela,November,2021,Great place and location
49529927,Letitia,November,2021,Beautiful and convenient location. with lovely amenities! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
49529927,Jeannette,October,2021,Nice place. just like the pictures and accesible location to all the spot we wanted to visit.
49529927,Jackie,July,2021,The space is just as pictured. We had a tiny bit of trouble finding it even with pin but we were not far off. The window curtains are sheer. no chance of sleeping in! Bring an eye mask. Also the beds are hanging and sway a lot when you turn in bed. I actually felt nauseas at times. Not the most comfortable.
49529927,Mario,July,2021,Great Spot for Weekend. great location. Cozy. perfect for couples
49529927,Diamarie,July,2021,This spot is a little gem. The location is super convenient. the pool is nice and Allison was very quick to respond to all our needs. The small kitchen was very useful  and the hanging swing beds were a trip ( unless you get dizzy easily). The staff was lovely.I stayed in unit 1. I would recommend a different unit if you mind being right on the street. The front bedroom faces the street and parking lot. The bedroom‚Äôs see through curtains do not provide any protection from morning light. nighttime light posts or privacy. However. when I mentioned it to the host. her team came up with a fast temporary solution for me.
49529927,Claudia,July,2021,Allison was a fantastic host. During our stay. Rinc√≥n had multiple power outages due to a hurricane. Allison let us stay for free at another property while the problem was resolved. She was incredibly helpful and generous!
49529927,Shobhit,June,2021,Amazing location and comfortable stay! Very near to peaceful beach and good guide for the must visit places nearby by Allison
49529927,Agata,June,2021,Lovely and close to everything we wanted to experience :)

1145041,Rob,July,2022,Great location in super quiet neighborhood with nearby trails to beach. Very spacious property with amazing view as well. I stayed very comfortably with a group of four and we had a great time hanging out on the rear deck and front balcony and even had a chance to talk to some of the neighbors. Super friendly neighborhood. I would stay here again without hesitation.
1145041,Aisha,July,2022,Very nice location.
1145041,Alicia,June,2022,Clean. spacious. comfortable. great view of the ocean.
1145041,Emily,March,2022,Another great stay in Rincon! Bobby's house is centrally located for quick curvy drives to many beaches and awesome restaurants. Wonderful coffee-drinking views of the ocean from the porch in the morning and shady back porch in the afternoons for relaxing or grilling. Thanks again!
1145041,Stephanie,March,2022,Spacios flat in a calm & symphathic neighborhood a little away from big happenings or beaches. To enjoy Ricon as it‚Äôs best you‚Äòd need your own car.
1145041,Bryan And Elyse,February,2022,Bobby‚Äôs place was great. clean and spacious. Kitchen had everything we needed and outdoor porches in the front and back were perfect.
1145041,Tom,February,2022,Great spot located just minutes from some of the best surf spots in Rincon.The view from the balcony on the upper unit was incredible; a perfect way to end the day and watch the sunset.My fianc√©e and I would definitely stay here again!
1145041,Carli,January,2022,The spacious apartment is on a magnificent street offering a view of the ocean/waves from Domes to Marias. The windows have screens (nice for mosquitoes) but I had to clean them in order to appreciate the view.The kitchen is fully equipped and has a gas stove and bbq. Water was hot and had good pressure. There are 2 sets of stairs to go up. which is a bit of pain if you pack too much (like me). I was able to leave the surfboards and wash them on the first floor patio.
1145041,Yoko,November,2021,The house was huge and had a great view. It was very quiet all through the day. Close to very where. Now I realize I‚Äôm Rincon you don‚Äôt have to stay beach side since you need a car anyway. Bobby‚Äôs place was so perfect. Lots of space and super clean. And Bobby was always available to communicate when we needed. That was awesome! I will definitely stay there again.
1145041,Joshua,October,2021,Incredible stay in a comfortable home located atop of puntas for great sunsets. Perfect distance to easily check multiple surf breaks as well as overlooking domes and the lighthouse. Thanks Bobby!
1145041,Jorge,October,2021,We really enjoyed our stay. it is very comfortable and spacious. The back terrace has two ceiling fans which keep it breezy. The front terrace has view of the sunset. You can see the waves breaking at Domes from the kitchen. Great location. between Domes and Sandybeach.
1145041,Kristin,August,2021,El Mirador Villa is a spacious and charming 2 unit house rental located in a prime location in Rinc√≥n close to the lighthouse and the Puntas neighborhood. Plenty of great food options only a couple minutes away by car (or if you're up for walking the hilly neighborhood of Puntas. about a 15-20 minute walk). including the Beach House. Calypso. and Tamboo. It is a very safe and quiet neighborhood. The house was very large and private. We stayed in the upper unit and didn't even realize someone was also staying in the downstairs unit! I enjoyed the spacious back patio to do a little bit of work and relax. which was very comfortable thanks to some powerful patio fans that kept the ocean breeze moving throughout. My coworker enjoyed the front balcony where she lounged in the hammock with a spectacular view of the ocean. Domes. and the lighthouse. The two bedrooms were spacious and comfortable with air conditioning. The views from the very large kitchen were spectacular. Just a wonderful unit all around that I was delighted to stay at. I look forward to visiting again and staying at this gem of a house rental!
1145041,Iris,August,2021,You well enjoy the house!!! Have everything you need !!!! Very clean!
1145041,Myles,August,2021,Bobby's place was a great stay for our group of surfers/work from home. Wifi was solid. though we used the dial-feature for Zoom to ensure connection. Place is cozy. the bedrooms get super cold with the AC but the kitchen can get pretty toasty in the summer. Awesome neighborhood. the place is super close to the Beach House - a great bar & restaurant with ocean views and close to Domes beach for surfing. We really enjoyed the balcony with an ocean view for our morning coffee or sunset beers. Great value for the price - we'd definitely come back.
1145041,Gabriel,August,2021,The space was beautiful! perfect view of the ocean and DR!
1145041,Camran,July,2021,Great view.  Big apartment with nice front and back deck with ocean view.  Bobby was helpful with check-in/check-out.  Buiding is a little outdated but the location is good.
1145041,James,July,2021,nice place with an awesome view
1145041,Polina,July,2021,The view from the terrace is amazing. We had all we needed. Location is close to everything.
1145041,Michael,June,2021,Nice. big place near the water. As advertised and a quality stay. Some windows do not close and mosquitos get in and the Internet/power is spotty at times but those are pretty difficult to control! Would stay again.
1145041,Nile,May,2021,Bobby‚Äôs place is absolutely beautiful and amazing. The view is second to none. The bedrooms are comfortable the beds are comfortable and the place as a whole is fabulous. I was sad to have to check out and would recommend anyone who is visiting Rincon PR to give Bobby‚Äôs place a go if it‚Äôs not already booked. Bobby was a great communicator and ensured we had an enjoyable stay! Definitely a 10/10 loved it
1145041,Michael,April,2021,Great view. Nice neighbors. Coqui frogs sound amazing at night. Close to all surf breaks plus a washer and dryer
1145041,Will,April,2021,100% would recommend had a great time
1145041,Dane,March,2021,Spacious second floor apartment with a front and back deck.  Views were incredible!  Great for a family as well.
1145041,Nicole,March,2021,Beautiful villa in a friendly neighborhood with a pretty ocean view. It's the perfect place to stay if you're looking for a beachy getaway.
1145041,Brooks,February,2021,This place is fantastic! Pictures don't do justice. Much larger in person which was fantastic. The upper deck was great to watch the sunset and the back patio was perfect for storing our surfboards and eating dinner outside. The neighborhood is very quiet so a reminder to not be too loud as sound travels easily. Overall a fantastic stay and can't wait to return to Rincon! I would recommend Bobby's place for sure!
1145041,Ben,January,2021,The Villa was much larger than we thought and is in the perfect location.  Easy to find. easy to check in.  Great for surfers.  Yes you need a car to get around in PR but you already knew that. Villa is located in a quiet neighborhood and the neighbors were very nice. I will definitely be back!
1145041,Katherine,January,2020,A Fantastic air bnb experience. The space was big. open and homely. The balcony had perfect sunset views and the amenities were great. We cooked every night and were able to walk to the the beach and coffee spots within 10minutes. We had a car to drive to the town plaza/gym/sandy beach and loved the experience of feeling like a local. Neighbours are friendly and willing to help (we had a flat battery and were offered so much assistance.) The house is well kept. has everything you need and the rooms are spacious and air conditioned. Everything was easy and well communicated. And early too! Loved getting check in info in advance. A smooth air bnb experience. We cant wait to come back!! Thank you!!!
1145041,Ashur,December 2019I hesitate to write such a strongly negative review. but it seems to me that the owner doesn't know how to properly run a property remotely and doesn't much care either. I say this as a working professional property manager.  Windows: The jalousie (louvered hand crank) windows have been broken since at least Jan,2016,(See Elissa's review from then). That's over 4 years and he hasn't replaced them. They don't close anymore and so let in heat. humidity. and bugs. Cooling: There are only window ACs and only in the bedrooms.  There is no cooling in the living room. or kitchen. Bobby stated that his electrical system is too old to handle adding window units to the front. Fair enough. then upgrade your electrical service and/or add central air which is quieter. will cool the whole house.  and uses less electricity. Appliances: Most of the appliances are very old (over 20 years old) and partially work. You have to match light the stove top.  Utilities:  Gas for cooking and clothes dryer is provided by a couple of ~100 lb tanks on the side of the house. One ran out while we were there and I had to go turn on the other one. Most homes I could see had much larger ~500 lb tanks. Water is provided through an above ground cistern as the local water supply is apparently not consistent. But due to the way this system is designed. there is an air gap and therefore the water is not suitable for drinking. Make sure to buy water for drinking at the local market. IMPORTANT: Bobby has no back-up generator on-site. and due to the poor design of his water service. if the power is out. which happened while we were there. lasted ~20 hours. and is not infrequent according to the locals we spoke with. you will also have NO WATER at all in the unit.  I had to spend parts of my vacation from being a property manager as Bobby's property manager troubleshooting issues with the windows. air conditioning. cleanliness of the unit. interruptions in the gas supply. interruptions in the water supply. and a power outage.  In fairness. he did respond to most requests ( sent out a cleaning lady and the property manager). He was polite. though clearly out of his depth. Hopefully he will find a quality property manager and choose to reinvest in long overdue repairs. let alone upgrades.  Bobby should have offered a credit for a few days for each of the units we rented (we rented both the upper villa and the lower villa) but he didn't. A professional understands when they have failed in their commitments and seeks to find a reasonable remedy or accommodation to make things better. That did not happen here. That was both surprising and disappointing.Show moreResponse from BobbyJanuary 2020I do appreciate Ashur‚Äôs feedback but he is a tough critic. I am doing my best  to make it the best experience possible for my guests and I  have multiple people that come back year to year and absolutely loved staying at El Mirador.  As we all know. this is a tropical island and nothing is perfect. I challenge him to have found a place. specially during the holiday season for the cost he paid.  Yes. he did have some setbacks and I apologize for that but I did my best to cater to his needs.   Some things are beyond my control but the ones that are I promise to address ASAP.Show more

1145041,Chad,December,2019,Bobby‚Äôs place is a very spacious. clean. and centrally located spot on top of the hill! This is a great place to stay with a great host who responds almost within seconds of any questions or concerns you might have.  I spent 6 days at Bobby‚Äôs place with a buddy on a surf trip and could have easily stayed there for a month or two! The location of the house makes it super easy to get to either side of the point within minutes!  Thanks again Bobby. we‚Äôll see you soon for sure!
1145041,Christopher,June,2019,El Mirador (upper unit) is a very spacious and clean space with a wonderful view from the hill above Domes Beach. Although located on a quiet residential street. be prepared to get a wake up call from the local roosters. It's a quick hop to Domes Beach. Sandy Beach. Steps. and the center of town. Would definitely stay here again.
1145041,Ricardo,April,2019,Great WIFI! Very clean.
1145041,Julio,July,2018,Great location. ample space living area.  Needs better cleanliness. hope it is taken care of in the future.
1145041,Scott,April,2017,Loved the location of house and incredible views of sunset over the ocean.
1145041,Kelly,April,2017,This was my family's first visit to Rincon and we absolutely loved it.  The house is the perfect location with a great view.  close to the beach. the town. and all of the different areas of Rincon.  Comfortable space and manager very quick to respond to questions.  The front deck is the perfect place to enjoy morning coffee or relax at the end of the day.  Just be sure to bring your own beach towels.
1145041,Ryan,January,2017,Bobby & Bailey were awesome to deal with. Very quick communication. fair. and attentive. They really care that everything goes well with your stay. This house had a lot of room. beautiful views from the front porch. quiet neighborhood and just a short walk up the street to a great coffee shop/bakery or Happy Bowls for breakfast/lunch.
1145041,Jacob,January,2017,We enjoyed our time at Bobby and Bailey's place. Rincon is great. We had a couple small issues with the apartment. but otherwise it was nice. It seemed like the beach would be walkable. but it is not convenient to get to. You pretty much need a car for anywhere you're trying to go. The WiFi was not reliable. but the the bedrooms and bathroom were both very nice and clean. I would consider staying here again if I was visiting Rincon.
1145041,Braeden,December,2016,We booked this spot for a last minute trip to Rincon and were really happy with it! The neighborhood is quiet with beautiful panoramic views. and the apartment is very spacious (enough for 4 folks to stay comfortably). There are plenty of areas to sit. recline. read and relax without feeling like you are always on top of your fellow travelers. You'll need a car to get around (there is easy reserved parking in front of the building) and all the best beaches and restaurants Rincon has to offer are no more than a 5-10 minute drive away. The streaming Netflix and washer/dryer in unit and the cafe/shop a 2 minute walk away were extra bonuses! Would recommend to others.
1145041,Laurie,March,2016,This was a great place to stay. really spacious.  Nice & clean. everything we needed. with outdoor spaces in both the front (sea view) and in back (large and shady).   Bobby was very responsive. and worked hard to get us the longest stay available.
1145041,Kaitlyn,December,2015,We loved this place! The property manager met us at the place as soon as we arrived. gave us the keys. and we were good to go. The upper unit is very big - both bedrooms are large. big living area. very large dining area. and great outdoor space. The apartment is close to the top of the hill so has a nice view of the ocean. but also has a jungle feel (frogs chirp quite a bit at night!). Plenty of furniture and appliances too.  Only downside is it's a long walk to the beach - either 15 minutes through the path to Domes (interesting walk) or about 20 minutes down the hill to Pools Beach - but it's an easy 3 minute car ride and you need a car in Rincon anyways.  All in - a great place to stay and we will definitely be back!
1145041,Mindi,December,2015,Great apartment with great views and good location close to town and the best post surf breakfast spot - happy bowls! It is walkable to Domes and Marias (at least 15-20 mins) but very quick in the car to all the surf breaks/beaches. The apartment was huge. very clean. nicely decorated. with plenty of space for a few people and well equipped with everything you need. Bobby was very helpful and responsive as was the agent Elier who met us with a big smile on his face and plenty of helpful information at 3am! It was great to be able to get away and relax when we wanted to but be close enough to town. We loved our stay and would definitely stay there again.
1145041,Response from Bobby,July,2015,Thanks! Hope to see you back in the future
1145041,Katrina,May,2015,El Mirador Villa is in a great location and met our needs. Grilling on the lanai was lovely. and we enjoyed the hammock and views from the front balcony. We had our 7-month-old son with us. so conveniences like A/C and the washer/dryer were appreciated - though the A/C in the second bedroom wasn't working during our stay. There are minor improvements that could be made to make it an exceptional experience. but we would certainly recommend it to people looking for a home base to crash during a stay in Rinc√≥n.
1145041,Response from Bobby,May,2015,Thanks Michael. hope to see you guys back in the future!!
1145041,Response from Bobby,February,2015,Thanks John. we would love to have you back!!

1145041,Response from Bobby,January,2014,Thanks Brian. hope to see you back in the future!!
1145041,Response from Bobby,August,2013,Thanks for the review and also the heads up. I will have my roofer look into the bedroom leak asap. I will also talk to the neighbors about the dogs barking. Happy to hear you enjoyed yourselves.
1145041,Jacob,July,2013,"This place was fantastic. We had a great stay at ""el mirador"" in the upper unit. The layout of the house is very good and spacious. There has been thought of everything: a sofa area with cable tv. an outside table with a bbq grill. space for storing surfboads etc. The view is great too.The place was very clean and the outside area well kept.The location is also great. with only 3 minutes by car down the hill to domes beach (surf beach) and 7 minutes to Rinc√≥n public beach which is good for swimming.I hope I get a chance to stay there again."
20622919,Mark,July,2022,Stayed here for a work trip.  Quiet place on top of a mountain.  We enjoyed evenings on the deck with a pleasant breeze.  Owner was quick to respond with any of our inquires.
20622919,Gerardo,June,2022,Very well located property and superb maintained. We will repeat.
20622919,Ana,May,2022,Very comfortable place to stay. Nice. quiet and great view. The pool was very relaxing. Rooms were spacious. Everything was clean. I recommend it.
20622919,Juan Carlos,April,2022,Great host
20622919,Corey,April,2022,Great location with beautiful views. we ate breakfast down the road at the beach house which also had incredible views and delicious food. Owner was quickly responsive with our questions and helpful.
20622919,,MayraJanuary,2022,Great location and a spacious and clean apartment. James was quick to answer any questions we had.
20622919,Nick,January,2022,Nice apartment. very secure and had all the amenities you could ask for. We spent a lot of time lounging in the hammock on the porch. Running water stopped working at the tail end of our stay. I think due to the local water supply? Regardless. host ended up refunding us a night--couldn't ask for anything more!
20622919,Michael,November,2021,Great place in a very good location. Everything you need for a stay( I stayed for one month)   Beautiful view. refreshing pool gated parking.   Excellent communication with host.
20622919,Frances,September,2021,Gorgeous views . perfect weather. Location is near the beach not exactly beach Front but the neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. Very Clean apartment. washer & dryer came in very handy. Pro tip : the shower in the bedroom runs hot water and is very spacious.
20622919,Anne-Elyse,August,2021,Clean.simple. as described
20622919,Jelanie,August,2021,This place was amazing! I booked this the day before as a last minute surprise for my mom. Rincon is her favorite town in Puerto Rico and let me tell you the place did not disappoint. The views from the balcony were breath taking. The pool was convenient. my brothers had a blast. You won‚Äôt regret booking here! Thank you for an amazing time and great communication.
20622919,Christina M,July,2021,Relaxing place. beautiful view great for family quality time or just to escape your daily routine.  Host is very kind and gives you full attention if needed. very clean and comfortable. Near the town and tourist spots and great hanging areas

20622919,Response from James,July,2021,I am actually in the process of getting a new couch but everything is 6 months back ordered why did you recommend a new cleaning service?
20622919,William,June,2021,Location is very nice on hill side. quite neighborhood. From balcony. the view of the sea and sunset was amazing!  Host was very responsive! Check in instructions could have more details such as maps and wifi password.

Thank you so much. we'll definitely be staying here again.
20622919,Rene,April,2021,If you‚Äôre looking for a great place to stay to enjoy the best surfing spot in all of Puerto Rico. look no further. It‚Äôs   literally a 5 minute drive to wave heaven. Host is eager to please and responds lightning fast. There‚Äôs only one option for me when I need to get my surfing fill....Poinciana Condo is the way to go!

20622919,David,March,2020,The place is nice. very well located and spacious Check in and checkout was perfect We only had a bit of an issue with cleanliness of the place when we arrived

20622919,Carlos J,July,2019,The place was really nice. Easy access and comfortable. The pool was nice and since the sun is almost all the day warming the water. even at night it was warm. The host answered our questions and was nice to us.

20622919,Cynthia,June,2019,We stayed at James‚Äôs for a couple days. James was a great host and he was very understanding and accommodating. especially being that we booked the condo in short notice. Would definitely recommend!
20622919,Rafael E.,May,2019,Great place with good pool access.
20622919,Esther And Rosemary,March,2019,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
20622919,Jorge,December,2018,The apartment is very spacious. beautiful. secure. confortable sparkling clean. nice view and parking. Close to everything. Bars. Food. restaurants and specially the  beautiful beaches around. Will recommend anytime.
20622919,Cheril,October,2018,When we arrived at the apartment the toilet. shower and bathtub were very dirty. The a/c and the fan had a lot of dust (they must take months without cleaning) and for that reason did not work to its capacity. We contact James about the bathrooms cleaning issue and his answer was ‚Äúit was a last minute reservation so his employee didn‚Äôt have time to get ready the place‚Äù We contact James‚Äô employee to let him know that will not been arriving until 3-4 hours later. James charge $60.00 for a cleaning fee so it was not ok that the place were not clean when we arrived and we have to cleaning it. If the place were not ready to receive a guest James should not accept the request.  The place is advertising that is close to Balneario de Rinc√≥n but it is at 7 minutes from there. We followed the gps direction from the message we received from the host and when we get there the place was not found. After I called James‚Äô employee he told me that the apartment was across The Lazy Parrot Inn which is located at the mountain. We chose the place based on the location so it was disappointed that we were so far from the Balneario area.
20622919,Joanne,August,2018,Really nice place to stay everything y so close.
20622919,Brenda,July,2018,Awesome place. as describe and then some.. My family really loved the place.
20622919,Nicolmar√≠,July,2018,Great location and a big apartment with a view. Very Clean. Unfortunately the first night there was a blackout in the community that is located. There is no power generator and therefore no water either. I‚Äôm a local so I‚Äôm aware that after the hurricane there‚Äôs lots of ups and downs with the power grid. The pool was not working either. The maintenance team went and tried to fix it but it didn‚Äôt work. The funny thing is that the week before  our stay the pool was working (the neighbors told me) so  I guess it was Murphy's law. In general Rinc√≥n is awesome and we had a great time.
20622919,Noel,July,2018,"Nice place.very roomy but very difficult to get there at least for me.""Good luck"""
20622919,Tyler,July,2018,Great place. great pool! Cool surf boards/decor/amenities throughout. Would definitely stay again.
20622919,Carlos,July,2018,Is a great. comfortable place. the view is amazing and relaxing. Very quiet and close to restaurants. bars and best of all the beach. My 2 year old enjoyed it a lot as he was able to run around since is so spacious. We were 6 and  had a great family vacation.
20622919,Maria,June,2018,We love the place. We recommend it and will come again.
20622919,Response from James,June,2018,Ok thanks for feedback please return whenever you want
20622919,This is our second stay in this apartment in,May,2018,. The apartment is fantastic but this time around we didn't have running water for about 24 hours. I'd wish it was notified to us from the start that we were running from a water reservoir. Our stay turned uncomfortable. and we had to improvise. Nonetheless. I am confident that the owner will come up with a solution for future bookings.

20622919,Response from James,June,2018,I apologize that is why I have the reservoir since the hurricane the whole island has been that way and it is beyond my control.  I am surprised you were not aware of the utility issues since the hurricane was global news . also I am in NY and not able to be aware of when you are on public water or using the reserveShow more
20622919,Cee,May,2018,Nice place.
20622919,Edgar,May,2018,We loved James' apartment in Rincon. It was bigger than expected. very very clean and it had everything you would wish for a very comfortable stay if you'd wish to make it longer. The greenery and sea view was a charm. Communication was also great. I would highly recommend this place and I hope to be back soon! Thank you!
20622919,Linda,April,2018,Beautiful . clean. everything i wanted for my weekend.
20622919,Annalee,April,2018,James communicated the day before our reservation that there was no water in the community and we cancelled after discussing the issues on the phone.  However. due to his awesome communication we rebooked the day of when he texted to say the water was back on!  The location. space and amenities at Jame's place are great!  Unfortunately. when we arrived the floor was dirty. the sheets in both bedrooms were dirty/sandy and there was a used towel in the master.  After washing the sheets and sweeping the floor the rest of the stay was great.  My daughter especially enjoyed the pool and one of our favorite restaurants was only minutes away!  James is great and responds right away.  Thanks. again!

The house was close to Tamboo. delicious food and beautiful atmosphere. The staff tried to be very accommodating considering our late arrival. Also. there‚Äôs a nice bar with great coco mojito and good music. Both of these spots are walking literally one block. The host was great! Answered within seconds of request.
5103964,Stephanie,July,2022,Great place. excellent location
5103964,Kathleen,December,2021,Loved the location and the quick response from the owner when we had issues.  The house does need some upgrades/maintenance.  Luckily. the units that had issues didn‚Äôt affect us too much since we had the extra space to move to another unit. but for parties that need every unit. it would be an issue.  Very relaxing stay though and hopefully if we get back to the area. some of that work will be done.

32655151,Valerie,December,2022,We absolutely love Puerto Rico and stay often in this building. This was our first time staying in this unit.  The building is great. quiet and private. Right on the beach which is beautiful. This unit however could really use some TLC. VR Help was very responsive in getting the unit cleaned and fixing the dryer but the unit definitely needs a good deep cleaning and some fixing up. There were many small things that didn‚Äôt work and needed maintenance. The pillows on the beds need to be replaced as they were all clumpy. There were no extra sets of sheets. extra pillows.  We had to request extra bath towels as we were only left 6 and we are a family of 4.  The downstairs storage unit is shared with another unit which we were not made aware of until a rented board of ours went missing. We were able to get it back but if we knew the storage was shared we would not have stored our rented equipment there.Response from VR HelpJanuary 2023We appreciate all feedback from our guests. and we can confirm the unit is clean and has comfortable pillows and bedding for our guests.

Condo was fully equipped. When we needed something host was quick to respond and take care of it. I would recommend this place to anyone. Thanks for a great week!
32655151,Joanna,April,2022,Fabulous! Highly recommend. You cannot beat the location! Such a gorgeous view. right on the beach. Quiet and relaxing yet steps from cute coffee shops. little market. awesome restaurants. live music. even a massage place right on the beach. We'd go back in a heartbeat.
32655151,Robert,March,2022,Local bars and restaurants In a very short 5 min walk.  I hesitate to tell everyone everything we love about this place because we love it much.!!
32655151,Bev,February,2022,What a find! We spent a wonderful 2 weeks here and had a terrific time. The balcony is fantastic to sit and watch the waves and the surfers. and the beach activity as well. House was clean and roomy for four. good WiFi. great A/C. plenty of towels. Several restaurants close to walk. we also cooked in the unit as well. The beach is extensive. you can walk for miles! Host Shawn and local contact Wesley were very responsive and helpful. Loved our time and hope to return.
32655151,Bobbi,January,2022,This place is Everything you could want in a rental.  comfy beds. clean cute environment and beautiful view. Can't go wrong with this one!
32655151,Monique,October,2021,Amazing view great spot off the beach and near many restaurants and downtown Rinc√≥n. Shawn is great and very accommodating and always quickly responded.
32655151,Erin,September,2021,beach location and very private. small. but very nice shaded pool. host is very communicative. large space and stocked!
32655151,Kathryn,September,2021,This was a very nice property and wonderful location! Shawn addressed all our concerns to our 100 %  satisfaction..would definitely stay there again.
32655151,Elisa,August,2021,Shawn‚Äôs place is excellent!!! Very clean it‚Äôs equipped with everything ..the location is perfect !!!!
32655151,Response from VR Help,August,2021,"Adriana's ""poor communications"" comment offers an ideal opportunity to reiterate an important point to future guests: the Airbnb message thread is not the place to report urgent matters during your stay. Rather. you are provided a number for a local contact who you are encouraged to text/call for any in-stay problems. Adriana experienced a small issue during her stay (resolved by building management in just over an hour) and messaged us in the thread multiple times within one hour for help. We do not monitor the Airbnb message thread 24 hours a day. and so it is crucial that guests follow our detailed protocol. With the issue long since resolved by the time we saw Adriana's messages. we felt no need to offer any further feedback. But that incident. sadly. led to a  ""poor communications"" comment and a 4 star rating.Show more"
32655151,Karla,July,2021,This is a beautiful condo in a very quiet. beautiful beach in PR. You are steps from the beach. The common areas are very well kept. The kitchen is well equipped with everything you need to make all your meals. The condo has a storage room with beach chairs. floaties. boogie boards. My family had an amazing time in Rincon.
32655151,Arica,July,2021,The location of Shawn‚Äôs place was better than described. We were literally steps away from one of the best beaches and a short drive away from tons of activities. The only suggestion I would make to guests. is to take a screen shot of access instructions. The cell service in the area is not the best. When we arrived and tried to login to AirBnB to retrieve the directions. we were unable. But. we made the best of a slightly annoying situation and ate at the awesome restaurant a few feet from Shawn‚Äôs place. Had a great meal. access to WiFi and got the info to get into the condo. If you are considering this place. don‚Äôt think twice. BOOK IT!! Thanks Shawn for everything.
32655151,Jenn,June,2021,Location. location. location. We loved our stay and would definitely stay here again. It‚Äôs obvious that Shawn cares about the condo and guests.
32655151,Eveka,June,2021,Condo was absolutely gorgeous. Spectacular views of the beach and pool area. Kitchen and bathrooms were properly stocked.Plenty of chairs and other essentials in the storage. Did I mention the views??? Waking up to the soothing sound of waves and having direct access to the beach makes this condo one of the best locations in Rincon.
32655151,Sujeil,May,2021,Cozy. spacious clean and amazing views. My family and I had an amazing stay. Can‚Äôt wait to go back.
32655151,Mike,April,2021,Great location for a relaxing vaca!   Condo is as described.  Shawn is very responsive to questions.  Surfers this is your spot!   Snorkeling. waterfalls. shopping. groceries and restaurants are all accessible from this location.  We recommend climbing the ‚Äúrock‚Äù at sunset for some amazing pictures!  We will recommend Shawn‚Äôs condo to friends and family.
32655151,David,April,2021,Is one of the best apartments I had been able to rent. Details like modern curtain blackouts. modern appliances. great tv and cable programming/channel selection. comfortable beds are very important for me. This apartment has it all. Also the access to Sandy beach is outstanding. There is a basement closet which includes beach chairs.  morey boogies and surfboards. It is easier to move beach chairs from this closet because it is nearby the access to the beach. The apartment also has most of the kitchen utensils with modern kitchen appliances. It also has a great view to the beach. I definitely recommend this apartment.
32655151,Erica,February,2021,This space was cozy enough for a family of 4.
32655151,Patricia,February,2021,Wonderful stay with amazing views! Will definitely stay again.
32655151,Dale,February,2021,Shawn's place was perfect for our family of 4...location was amazing. beach quiet for the most part and beautiful. Rincon is a wonderful little beach town and Shawn's condo is in the center of it all...yet private and quiet. Lots to do in the area or a short car ride away. We will definitely return and will look for any of Shawn's places as a consideration first. We loved our stay and everything about the condo was perfect for what we needed for our short stay. Juan was very responsive to our small issue and it was taken care of immediately. Thanks Shawn...hope to visit again. :)
32655151,Phil,November,2020,Beautiful place! Right on the beach.
32655151,Cristy,October,2020,We had an amazing time during our family vacations in Rinc√≥n and it was mostly because of this place. Villa Cuqui is just perfect. even better than the pictures. It is indeed fully equipped. has everything to make you feel at home. and has prime location: it is right in front of the best beach in town. in a nice neighborhood. We love staying at Bo. Puntas but this was by far the best place we have stayed. If you are considering staying at Villa Cuqui. do not hesitate. you won‚Äôt regret it. We definitely will be back soon!
32655151,Erin,August,2020,The condo itself and location were absolutely amazing. Sandy Beach. in our opinion. is the best beach to stay at in Rincon area.  The condo is beachfront with an unobstructed view of the ocean. Waking up and drinking coffee in the morning on the balcony looking at the ocean was my absolute favorite thing to do.  The beds were super comfortable with AC units in each room. The condo is very tastefully decorated with attention to detail. The kitchen is fully equipped to prepare and cook anything imaginable. There are board games and beach toys available. We look forward to booking Shawn‚Äôs condo again!
32655151,Jaime,August,2020,Great location. Definitely will stay again.  Even with Covit 19 and Storm Isaac. we felt safe and relax.  You have everything you need in the apartment.
32655151,Ramon,July,2020,This property is a Five-Stars location with a beautiful view just in front of the beach. All the facilities are super clean with good taste in decoration and well-equipped in the kitchen area.
32655151,Bernardo,July,2020,This was the perfect getaway after so many weeks in lockdown.  The apartment has a great location. very clean and comfortable.  Shawn has very accesible at all times and accomodating to our requests. We will definitely be back.
32655151,Hector,July,2020,The location is so great that we didn‚Äôt have to move our car during our entire stay. Shawn is an excellent host. communication was great and the apartment‚Äôs amenities were beyond my expectations.
32655151,Joy,June,2020,Villa cuqui is beautiful. convenient. and spacious. Spectacular views and the best spot on the beach.
32655151,Katherine,June,2020,This place was amazing!! The apt. was just as pictured. Everything was clean and perfectly set up. Check in/out was easy and the location is amazing. We had a wonderful time and will return soon!
32655151,Jen,March,2020,Spectacular view and lovely ocean breezes!  Great for those who surf as there is a great break right out front and two more spots within walking distance.  The condo was sparkling clean. comfortable and well appointed.  Host response to texts and email was very quick and helpful.  We had a great stay and would re-book next time we are in Rincon.
32655151,Brandon,October,2019,Nothing short of 5 stars for this apartment. The host was extremely communicative when I had questions. The apt itself was sparkling clean and had a few things like spices to cook some meals with. Very thoughtful. The location of the apt is perfect for surfers as it‚Äôs situated on a corner with some exceptional swell. A few blocks down the water is a bit more tame for casual swimming. We were there in the off season. so some things were closed. but the few bars that were walkable were lively. Tamboo is steps away and has great food. and a Friday night DJ party.
32655151,Jose,August,2019,This place was exactly what my family of four needed.   The location was great and the beach was amazing.  The host really thought of EVERYTHING we could have needed. There were so many times we were like ‚Äúoh wow. they have that too‚Äù. The place was a jewel. and we really loved how it was decorated. All amenities were of such good quality as well. Overall an amazing visit to Villa Coqui!
32655151,Matthew,August,2019,This was our best stay yet! We have stayed in other locations on the west coast of the island and this location was excellent. The amenities and details of the condo were thoughtful. The condo itself was super clean and all the furniture was so comfortable. It truly felt like we were at home. The beds were like sleeping on a cloud! Loved waking up to the sound of the ocean every morning. The pool was such a nice treat for the kids! We will definitely be staying again! Highly recommended!!
32655151,Katherine,July,2019,Great property. well maintained. Great for families with kids. Views are amazing. Love the location.
32655151,Lee,July,2019,Shawn's place is pretty amazing. The location in Rincon on Sandy Beach is fantastic! The upscale and stylish accommodations were more than expected! Shawn provided everything for a very comfortable home away from home experience! The beds were very comfortable and the furniture was perfect for our party of 6! I would highly recommend this place!
32655151,Joe And Lesa,April,2019,Shawn‚Äôs place was amazing. Looked around Rincon and we wouldn‚Äôt want to stay anywhere else! will defiantly stay by Shawn again‚Äô - close to everything. Amazing beach front.  Coffee right across the  street  each morning ‚Äò very comfortable beds! Slept like a baby!  Had all the things we wanted - pool . cable . WiFi. beach front . washer dryer. secure parking! And much much more! Great communication! Easy check in and out! Loved our stay!  Had beach chairs and a bathroom poolside!  Thanks Shawn . you made our vacation with all the amenities.! Until next year!! Julia and Lesa
32655151,Eva B.,March,2019,Loved this apartment on Sandy Beach. Every detail was tended to in this beautiful place. Highly recommend it. We didn‚Äôt want to leave.
53549379,Jose,December,2022,Prime location.
53549379,Priscila,May,2022,When we arrived. everything looked nice and clean. However. we found four live roaches in the apartment (by the bed. the TV area and a beach towel.). There was construction upstairs and something happened because through the 1st night there was a leak over my bed. Vero was quick to respond. they fixed the leak and mentioned that they exterminate every month. maybe she need to change exterminators or maybe was the construction. Based on the above. I would have hoped for a small discount due to the inconvenience. However. the facilities were nice and we enjoyed our stay.
53549379,Beck,April,2022,Relax and unwind in an adorable. spotless room with easy access to everything you could ever want to do in and around the Rincon area. Vero is just a sweetie and you will love the adorable rooms they rent! What a treasure!
53549379,Jackie,March,2022,Happiness is a wonderful place to stay.  Beautiful courtyard and convenient walking distance to Sandy Beach! Vero went above and beyond to help us out. Great place for multiple families. Courtyard is amazing!  Would stay again!
53549379,Jeff,February,2022,Vero is awesome.  So responsive and nice.  You can tell the property is run efficiently and in excellent condition.  I have been going to Rincon for years. this location is just about as easy as it gets..
53549379,Tyler,February,2022,Beautiful property. Vero was super nice-very attentive and quick to respond to minor requests. Ice cold AC in all the rooms. very clean and comfortable. and amazing chill area with pool/lounge chairs/couches outside. We fit 5 people comfortably with one on the futon and one couple in each of the 2 beds. Easy parking and safe. Quick walk to the beautiful Sandy Beach. Jake's Java coffee shop. Jack's Shack food. Tamboo dinner w/ a view. Big Kahuna burger bar. and Casa Isle√±a brunch spot were our favorites walking distance. Construction on the top floor units started early around 7am but didn't matter quite much as we were early risers chasing the surf. Would love to stay again!
53549379,Response from Vero,March,2022,We are very sorry for the inconveniences and that we couldn‚Äôt issue the 50% refund. However. we do notify that the property is still under construction and yes noise is to be expected. Some days more than others. The time of the noise will depend on each days work.  We automatically issued a refund for the night with the mouse incident which was extremely unfortunate. horrifying and unheard of. We keep the premises clean and have an exterminator come regularly.  However. we couldn‚Äôt grant the guest request for 50%  of the total. because of the noise. as we have it notified that there will be noise. We learn from every experience. and try to do better every day. We are grateful for your input. We are very very sorry you didn‚Äôt have the best experience and truly hope you will return once construction is done. and that you have a spectacular experience.Show more
53549379,Holly,January,2022,Let me just start by saying we‚Äôve stayed many places in Rincon. and this was by far one of our favorite stays! The location is incredible. right across the street from the beach and Tamboo (a great bar for oceanfront drinks/dinner) and Casa Verde is a short distance away which is a great bar at night. We also walked to breakfast at Casa Islena.  The surf is incredible at Sandy Beach. Vero was responsive and had everything that we needed in the condo. The pool and grill made for great amentities. Thank you so much again. We will be returning soon!
53549379,Bianca,March,2022,If they go as a group. they should bring their own pots. the ones they have are small. They bring extra toilet paper. there is only one roll of toilet paper. All dusty surfaces like crockery There are no cleaning detergents or extra garbage bags. The stove has trouble turning on. The fridge didn't work. The sink is covered. the owner was notified. Vero responds quickly to any inconvenience in the house. The airbnb is comfortable and nice.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
9677681,Mark,November,2022,Vanessa was a considerate host!
9677681,Everett,August,2022,EXCELLENT STAY!! They had such good attention to detail- well equipped kitchen. beautiful views from comfortable deck furniture. they even have nice shampoo/conditioner which is rare! Will be back next time we are in PR :)
9677681,Laura,July,2022,Second time at the Boarding house. we love the space. Vanessa is very kind and always available. The view from the rooftop is magical. We really enjoy the stay.
9677681,Nuria,July,2022,The airbnb was very clean and with everything that you want or need for a perfect beach day. It is a little farther than expected to walk to some of the nearest bars. but very very close by car. The rooftop has amazing sunset views. Will definitely stay here again.
9677681,Response from Vanessa,July,2022,Forrest. thank you for this amazing review! I‚Äôm so glad you loved our place and you‚Äôre welcome back anytime!
9677681,Marisol,June,2022,Great spot! I needed a place to crash for the night after work and Vanessa‚Äôs spot was comfortable and cute. Super clean bathroom. kitchen and overall cleanliness. Also very tranquil.I would rent it again!
9677681,Response from Vanessa,June,2022,Thank you for the feedback. Unfortunately we do not have any other options for parking. Also. our guests have been parking in that same area across the street from the house for the last 19 years with no problems. I‚Äôm sorry it felt unsafe to you.Show more
9677681,Mike,June,2022,We have enjoyed it!
9677681,Paul,May,2022,Amazing place and hosts! It was so beautiful to wake up to the sunrise and birds chirping and relax on the roof while watching the neighborhood come alive.  The place was impeccably clean with everything in fully functional order (not an easy feat in those parts).  The hosts were incredibly responsive and generous. And the location phenomenal to easily get to the beach and bars but still come home to a relaxing and beautiful street.  This is the easiest 5 stars I could give.
9677681,Abner,May,2022,A wonderful stay. as always! Don‚Äôt forget to have meals /relax on the rooftop.
9677681,Gloryvee,April,2022,I love this whole place.  Pineapple Apartment is very comfortable. beautiful and very clean.  The roof top is beautiful.  It has a good location. minutes from the best beaches. the town and restaurants.  Vanessa responds quickly.  Access to the apartment is easy.  I recommend it and I will return.
9677681,Monique,April,2022,I walked into the most clean and comforting Pineapple apartment. Besides being beyond clean. the vibe was just welcoming in every room. Honestly waking up to that south bedroom view was my favorite in the nook. Do not miss being on the rooftop for a bit. I also would not worry about parking at all. super easy. Will definitely be coming back!
9677681,Steven,April,2022,Quiet spot with an amazing roof deck and just a 5 minute drive to the beaches.
9677681,Erika,March,2022,Vanessa‚Äôs place is wonderful. Clean. comfortable. and close to everything one could need for a relaxing stay in Rinc√≥n. The roof patio is amazing. Vanessa is very responsive via the app should questions arise.

9677681,Response from Vanessa,February,2022,Thanks for the review Disha! I‚Äôm sorry the bed was not comfortable for you. It is a Queen sized mattress and we provide a heavier quilt in the bedroom dresser for guests that prefer that. Happy to hear everything else was great for you!Show more
9677681,James,February,2022,Vanessa's place was literally perfect. The apartment itself was incredibly homey. On the terrace upstairs you could not only see breathtaking views of the ocean during the day. but you could also see unbelievable views of the stars at night. The location was also perfect. With a car. everything from restaurants. beaches. to surf schools were only 3-15 minutes away. I would highly recommend this place to a friend.
9677681,Felisha,January,2022,I highly recommend! It‚Äôs a beautiful place to stay. Very clean. comfortable bed. beautiful view from the bedroom window. Nice to have a private balcony. And the shared rooftop is gorgeous!
9677681,Monica,January,2022,We had a great stay in the Pineapple suite. The room was very comfortable. and we enjoyed spending time on the roof soaking in the magnificent views. Rincon has a lot of hills so you will need a car. but the location is just a 3 minute drive to Sandy Beach (one of our favorites!) Would definitely stay here again next time we visit the area.
9677681,Response from Vanessa,January,2022,Thanks so much Boone!! We loved having you both at the house and can‚Äôt wait to have you back!
9677681,Ryan,December,2021,Awesome place to stay! The kitchen is well equipped! They included everything you would need. including Tupperware containers and a cooler for lunches on the go! The roof top provides amazing 360 views and a great spot for your morning coffee! The hosts were very easy to communicate with and quick to respond. Great location. Would highly recommend!
9677681,Tina,December,2021,This is one of my favorite places to stay. It‚Äôs clean and easy to travel to surf spots and restaurants. Vanessa and Greg are amazing hosts and that‚Äôs one of the many reasons I came back to the boarding house.
9677681,Cathy,December,2021,The Pineapple room is magical! The space is airy. comfortable. clean. and has everything you need for a great stay in Rincon. We were excited to find beach chairs. towels. a cooler. beach umbrella waiting for us...just pack your swimsuit and good vibes. The rooftop was stunning and the perfect place to enjoy your morning coffee. a mid afternoon hammock nap or a sunset cocktail. Vanessa and Greg are awesome hosts and it's obvious they consider even the smallest details to make your stay as pleasant as possible.  Huge thanks!
9677681,Caroline,November,2021,Our stay at The Boarding House was wonderful! Everything was clean and convenient. The perfect location and the rooftop was such a treat! We loved it all!

9677681,Response from Vanessa,November,2021,Thank you for this awesome review! It was such a pleasure to host you. and I‚Äôm so happy that you were comfortable here. I know we will see you again!
9677681,Katy,August,2021,Two girlfriends and I came to celebrate our birthdays together and hike in Rincon. To say the rooftop has a gorgeous view is an understatement. It was the most beautiful place to relax for a few days. Vanessa was so kind and communicative. I would absolutely stay there again.
9677681,Gerrit,August,2021,What a lovely place. The location is on top of the hill with beautiful views of Rincon. You will need a car to get around. Though you technically can walk to some restaurants and beaches. Would come back any time. Yes it can happen that the power goes out but it is really not a problem. Vanessa tries her best to fix it and use her generator and solar panels.
9677681,Don,July,2021,Cute place! Great location. amazing roof deck. host was responsive. clean. will recommend.
9677681,Humberto,July,2021,I had a short stay but would definitely come back. The beach chairs where a life saver.
9677681,Response from Vanessa,July,2021,We are so glad you enjoyed your stay Mariah. and thank you for the very kind review! We agree. we sure wish we had a better parking situation. Unfortunately there just isn‚Äôt another option with our location. Fortunately. in the almost 7 years we‚Äôve been here. we haven‚Äôt had any issues with the street parking!Show more
9677681,Response from Vanessa,July,2021,I am so sorry about the power! A new power company took over on the island. and there has definitely been a steep learning curve for them! Thankfully we have a small solar set-up and a generator to run most things in the house. I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed your stay and thanks for the review!Show more
9677681,Mufaddal,June,2021,Amazing views and great value!

9677681,Response from Vanessa,June,2021,It was great hosting you Melanie!
9677681,Jos√©,May,2021,Great place! Very central location; close to various food spots. beaches and local commerce.If you notice it‚Äôs about to rain. make sure to close the windows of the master room. Other than that. you‚Äôve got all you need for a relaxing stay.Any doubts. feel free to contact Vanessa; she‚Äôs always available
9677681,Elaine,May,2021,Great place!!!  The place was pretty awesome and the rooftop is out of this world!!!
9677681,Response from Vanessa,May,2021,Hey Jean!  Thank you for that absolutely amazing review! I‚Äôm just so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us! Also. thank you for letting me know about the leak. Every single summer there are new leaks in new places. It rains so much so quickly and just soaks into the concrete. We are constantly chasing after those leaks unfortunately. I appreciate you letting me know and I‚Äôm glad it did not impact your stay!Show more
9677681,Samuel,April,2021,I stayed at Vanessa‚Äôs place with my wife and son. We thoroughly enjoyed staying at her place. The rooftop was the most pleasant place to work remotely. The view was wonderful. Location was excellent - quick access to many family friendly beaches. Great food including vegan places around. I would have stayed even longer if I could. I‚Äôm certainly coming back.
9677681,Jennifer,April,2021,Great place to stay and value for rinc√≥n
9677681,Daniel,April,2021,Had a great stay at the Pineapple room. The house is in a perfect location and Vanessa was helpful with everything we needed.
9677681,Response from Vanessa,April,2021,Thank you so much for the review! I didn‚Äôt realize that it was actually broken. so I am so sorry! We are redoing that entire bathroom this fall. Next time. it will be a while different experience!
9677681,Grinoshka,February,2021,Beautiful view. peaceful place. perfect getaway to relax!
9677681,Gleb,January,2021,A beautiful experience. We came to have a healthy well rounded stay and we left with that and so much more. The place is of the ocean!
9677681,Response from Vanessa,January,2021,I appreciate the kind words about me. however I just don‚Äôt agree with your entire review.  We are set up to be a short-term vacation rental. not a long term rental spot.  That being said. I feel the rooms are properly equipped with everything you need for your stay with us. Our rates are adequate for the amenities that we provide. We do not claim to be a fancy place. and not having hot water in the sinks. and having the plug in shower. is super common on the island. I‚Äôve never had anyone complain about the utensils in the kitchen or the lack of towels in the room. We definitely cater to super chill. laid-back people because that‚Äôs what Rincon is. We provide a very clean and comfortable space. I feel I went above and beyond during your stay Alexandra.  I‚Äôm sorry we didn‚Äôt meet your higher standards.Show more
9677681,Rebecca,December,2020,Beautiful views from the rooftop. Very well maintained and cleaned. Loved this place! Very friendly hosts. Can't wait to return again :)
9677681,Jacqueline,December,2020,Had a nice stay at Vanessa and Greg's house. The upstairs patio is as lovely as it seems. Great for reading a book and relaxing. Vanessa was always super responsive and the location is in good driving proximity to everything.
9677681,Carlos,September,2020,Excellent Host! helped us with locations and always responded fast. Amazing view and super chill vibes.
9677681,Kyri√©,September,2020,What an amazing apartment! My boyfriend and I extended our stay here twice. and ended up spending a full month at Vanessa's place. We so enjoyed the peaceful rooms. the view and ocean breeze. and the amazing rooftop. We walked every day to the nearby Sandy Beach - there are a few great bars & restaurants within walking distance as well. Definitely stay here! Vanessa is a wonderful and helpful host!
9677681,Kyri√©,August,2020,Vanessa's home is so beautiful and we wished we could stay longer - so we did! The rooftop is breathtaking and such a calm place to hang out and look at the ocean and catch the breeze. A 15min walk down to the closest beach. and a short drive to all the others and into the center of town. Rincon is a true treasure!  Vanessa is also super nice and responsive if you ever have questions. Hope to return!
9677681,Eric,August,2020,Great place. A few minutes drive from the beach. Super fast and helpful hosts.
9677681,Stephanie,July,2020,The Boarding House is an amazing stay in the heart of Rinc√≥n. We stayed in the Pineapple Suite and were mesmerized with the beautiful ocean view from our room. The suite was fully equipped with everything we needed including beach accessories like chairs and a cooler. The rooftop terrace was perfect for having breakfast with a view and stargazing at night. The house was very clean and the self check-in was very easy. Vanessa and Greg were great hosts and quickly responded our questions.
9677681,Adrienne Nicole,July,2020,The Boarding House is a relaxing and comfortable place to stay with a beautiful view from the rooftop area. Every afternoon we would go to the rooftop to watch the sunset and in the morning I went there to meditate and do yoga. which was awesome! The room in itself was very pleasant. and Vanessa was always quick to respond to our messages when we needed something.
9677681,Yang,July,2020,The place is clean and cozy. rooftop is a gem where I spent afternoons reading and napping facing the ocean. Vanessa takes care of this place thoughtfully. She responded to my questions quickly and accommodated as much as she can.
9677681,Paola,June,2020,We loved Vanessa‚Äôs place! It‚Äôs the perfect place for a getaway. Vanessa was super nice and very easy to communicate with. The rooftop is even prettier in person. it‚Äôs a must see. I totally recommend ‚ú®
9677681,Andy,March,2020,Very clean and comfortable units with the most amazing roof deck to chill out on and watch the sun go down. Just a couple of minutes up the hill from all the beaches. Was the best place I‚Äôve stayed at in rincon to date!
9677681,Fred,March,2020,This suite was so perfect for our anniversary week. Vanessa was super helpful and had the low down on some great downtown spots. The sunsets were beautiful from the roof. and the vibes were great! The highest praise I can give is that it felt like home!
9677681,James,March,2020,Great space. really awesome view of the ocean. Didn‚Äôt feel the need to use the AC as there was a good breeze through the apt at night. Nice and quiet. bit away from the busier areas of Rinc√≥n but close to everything
9677681,Megan,February,2020,Our stay at the pineapple suite was absolutely sweet! Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to unwind after a long few days at the beach. Easy parking. amazing rooftop & views. and close to so many beaches and restaurants. Vanessa and Greg are amazing hosts and gave us great recommendations to enjoy our stay. Thank you for making it so hard to leave- we already want to book another trip back!
9677681,Sophie,February,2020,This place is truly amazing! It‚Äôs located in a great part of town near all of the best surfing beaches and good restaurants. The apartment was lovely. and clean. The roof is a really great addition. and looks exactly like the pictures. Having the beach essentials was a huge plus. and there was always coffee in the morning! I can‚Äôt say enough how great this place was! We will be going back! Vanessa is amazing! Quick to respond. and even helped me after hours when we were in a pickle! Makes the place really fantastic!
9677681,Christopher,February,2020,I stayed in the Pineapple suite. In addition to the fantastic roof top patio this suite had a private balcony area. Place was very clean. convenient and hosts Vanessa and Greg are mad cool! Hope I can come back soon!
9677681,Katherine,February,2020,Great value and absolutely gorgeous! This is pretty much the perfect beach house- the view from both the bedroom and the rooftop is incredible. Don‚Äôt be afraid of the roads- go slow and you‚Äôll be fine. The location is great since it‚Äôs about a 15-minute ride to anywhere in Rinc√≥n (restaurants. beaches. yoga. etc.) The guidebook Vanessa and Greg put together has tons of useful information. I‚Äôd stay here again in a heartbeat.
9677681,Response from Vanessa,February,2020,Thank you for this beautiful review!  You captured the feel of the rooftop perfectly! We enjoyed having you both here and would be so happy to host your family. Thanks again!
9677681,Roderic,January,2020,The Pineapple Suite was very clean and cozy. Located in the heart of my favorite part of Rinc√≥n. Vanessa was an outstanding host and did a great job making sure our stay was wonderful. The balcony attached to the suite was my favorite part of the room and the roof top was also a major bonus.
9677681,Danielle,January,2020,Vanessa is an amazing host! Her local recommendations are priceless and save time trying to guess best food. surf lessons. etc. The view and vibe on the rooftop is amazing. We will definitely be back!
9677681,Devin,December,2019,The place was clean and very nice. and Vanessa was a great host. Great view from the bedroom and rooftop!
9677681,Mindy,December,2019,Vanessa and Greg were great hosts. and I found everything as described in their profile. Like all reviewers. I found the rooftop an amazing space to hang out and relax.  So relaxing that I dozed off a number of times in one of the hammocks. Another nice surprise with the rooftop is that because it‚Äôs a common space. it also gives you the chance to make friends with some of the other guests.There‚Äôs easy access from their location to all the great beaches. restaurants and attractions.  At the same time the house is on a quiet residential street that makes it a great getaway from the hustle and bustle.
9677681,Henley,December,2019,We enjoyed our stay at the Boarding House! The rooftop area was absolutely amazing. such a wonderful. relaxing space! Wish we could‚Äôve stayed longer!
9677681,Camille And Tamar,December,2019,Great spot if you like beautiful views! The space is very cute but that rooftop is gold! The hosts were super kind and let us checkout whenever we needed as well as gave us awesome recommendations for the rest of our stay. I‚Äôd 100% come back!
9677681,Erin,November,2019,Do not pass this place by! Fantastic! You can tell that Vanessa takes great pride in her Airbnb. All the little things make for a wonderful experience! Every part of her place is amazing. The view. the rooftop. the bedroom with its amazing view. Beautiful breeze every day. We truly enjoyed the beach chairs and cooler. We added the umbrella and left for others to enjoy. I can‚Äôt wait to own my own piece of PR and I hope to have a place half as amazing as The Boarding House. 50000000 stars!
9677681,Saribel M.,October,2019,Gorgeous view. awesome amenities. LOVE the place and the decoration. The room view was perfect.
9677681,Alexandria,September,2019,If you're visiting Rincon for the first time or for your 100th time. stay here!! The rooftop is amazing. we spent alot of our time up there. Short trip to the beach. The hosts are kind and provided towels. chairs and a cooler!  Everything was amazing.
9677681,Luis A.,August,2019,Vanessa is a very nice and welcoming host. This a beautiful and peaceful place on the top of the hill. The bedroom has an amazing view of the Rinc√≥n. Aguada. and Aguadilla coastline. Very impressive. Loved the vibe! The place has all the gadgets (cooler. beach chairs. and snorkeling equipment) to have fun in Rinc√≥n.
9677681,Response from Vanessa,August,2019,I appreciate your feedback. however I do feel like a $25 cleaning fee is fair based on the size of the room and the time it takes to clean it.  I have never had any complaints about the cleaning fee.  trash or washing dishes.
9677681,Annemarie,July,2019,The stay at the Pineapple Suite was lovely. The roof terrace is great with good views and nice to just hang out. The Boarding House isn't in walking distance to any beaches but by car easy to reach.
9677681,Nicole,July,2019,Great apartment in a great location! The rooftop terrace was amazing for sunset hour. Apartment is just as described and seen in pictures. Would stay here again. Vanessa was very responsive during our stay; great communication!
9677681,Response from Vanessa,July,2019,Sarah.  thank you so much for this incredible review! I wish I would have had the pleasure to meet you when you were here. I‚Äôm so glad that you had an awesome stay at the house and I hope to see you the next time you visit .
9677681,Margo,June,2019,The rooftop area is so nice! Very comfortable space
9677681,Casuarina,June,2019,Vanessa is a wonderful host.  Very helpful and patient in answering all of our questions. The details can not go unnoticed. Fresh flowers and fresh coffee in the morning. Beautiful inside and the roof top deck was the highlight. Beautiful views of the ocean in a very tranquil space. Highly recommend staying here.
9677681,Marcos,June,2019,Vanessa was a great and responsive host. She was on top of everything and her availability was there if anything happened.Also. the place was gorgeous! It‚Äôs well located in Rincon and you can get anywhere fast. A great place to getaway for the weekend
9677681,Response from Vanessa,June,2019,Thank you so much!!
9677681,Nicolette,June,2019,The Pineapple Suite is the best place to wake up with a view of the ocean and the breeze coming in. Perfect for a low key weekend and in the best location with access to the best spots in Rinc√≥n.  Clean. quiet. cozy. lush - highly recommend The Boarding House for a restorative weekend in the west. The rooftop is absolutely stunning and the morning coffee is a great touch.  Vanessa was even accommodating with our request to check-out late and enjoy the morning paddleboarding. Thank you. Vanessa!  :)
9677681,Natalie,May,2019,What a fantastic place to relax and enjoy the beauty of Rinc√≥n. It makes the stay all that better with such a great host like Vanessa. Super responsive and kind. The room was fresh and clean...I truly felt at home. I can‚Äôt wait to return and would definitely recommend this spot.
9677681,Ryan,May,2019,Great spot to enjoy rincon. Rooms was fantastic. Roof was amazing.
9677681,Response from Vanessa,May,2019,Thanks Orlando!
9677681,Response from Vanessa,May,2019,Thank you! Wish we had met!!
9677681,Response from Vanessa,May,2019,Thanks Danielle! You guys are always welcome!
9677681,Nicolas,April,2019,Vanessa‚Äôs place is beautiful and equipped with all you need for a great stay in Rinc√≥n!
9677681,Frank,April,2019,We have stayed here once before and had to come back this time around. Honestly it was everything we remembered and more. The house has had a little make over since we were here last and it made it that much more beautiful and pleasant to stay. As ive stated in the past its location is key it is located between two of the beautiful beaches in rincon and many local bars and restaurants being super close. I know my girl friend and I enjoyed sandy beach and Maria's during the day and at night enjoyed drinks at the beach house . casa verde. and calypso. Honestly the last day there we took full advantage of the rooftop deck they had at the house and were able to have some drinks under the stars. We cant wait to come back and visit again their home is a place that brings comfort on every level. Thank you again for having us!!
9677681,Kirk,April,2019,Vanessa puts a lot of attention into details. and her place matches extremely well with the beachy vibe of Rincon
9677681,Melissa,March,2019,This is actually our second time staying in the Pineapple Suite at the Boarding House since my husband and I enjoyed it so much the first time!  The location is great - central to all the surf beaches.  The view is awesome from the rooftop deck and even just sitting up in bed.  The suite's kitchenette had all we needed for some quick meals.  Vanessa and Greg provided beach chairs. a cooler. and beach towels. which was great.  Just make sure to bring your own shampoo. conditioner. and bath soap.  Communication with the hosts was quick and easy.  The Boarding House is at the top of our list for places to stay in Rincon!
9677681,Robbie,March,2019,This place is great! It only takes a couple minutes to get the beaches and into Rincon. It is very clean and the roof top area is beautiful and a fun place to hangout. We enjoyed using the rooftop BBQ and eating dinner outside on the roof with the most amazing views .without having to worry about getting rained on. Also is very quiet at night. Over all a great place to be. The hosts are excellent and very responsive to any questions or concerns.
9677681,We spent three nights in the Pineapple room during the Corona surf contest in,March,2019,. The space was awesome. both the unit itself. which was spacious and well-equipped. and particularly the roof.  The apartment had a blender for pina colada making. which was a nice touch. it also came with towels and chairs for the beaches.  Coffee was ready for us every morning. which was also nice and unexpected.  Vanessa was super responsive and a pleasure to deal with.  Would definitely stay here again.

9677681,Eleonora,February,2019,I never write reviews but feel compelled to in this case. The Boarding House was the perfect place for a long weekend in Rincon. The house is beautiful and decorated very stylishly. The views from the bedroom and the roof are amazing. The house is in a great location - close enough to walk or quickly drive to the beach and close to food. Vanessa and Greg are wonderful. caring hosts who clearly put their heart into the boarding house. The best part of our stay was enjoying the roof deck. At night we enjoyed the starry sky. During the day we enjoyed a shaded breezy area with a great ocean view. I highly recommend this place. We will definitely stay here again!
9677681,Steven,January,2019,Great stay! Amazing location and very responsive host! Highly recommend to anyone staying in Rincon!
9677681,Response from Vanessa,January,2019,You guys are THE BEST!! I already miss having you here. Thanks for being so wonderful. We look forward to your next visit!
9677681,Zach,June,2018,Vanessa‚Äôs place is fantastic. The room was very cozy. and the rooftop was great. She was so nice. provided us with information of the town. and was pretty much always available. We had to leave a night early. and she was even helpful with that. Great host. cool house. and great vibes!
9677681,Denise,June,2018,Cute. great location and attentive host. Would definitely stay again
9677681,Raquel,April,2018,Vanessa and her husband were awesome hosts. The pictures doesn‚Äôt do justice at all to the place. Awesome and breath taking views from both. the bedroom and the rooftop. The cross ventilation at the Pineapple suite makes you feel like you don‚Äôt need the turn the A/C at all. Fresh coffee every day. fresh towels. beach towels. clean linens. comfy bed. a complete equipped kitchen. small cooler for you to take to the beach and they even have beach chairs for your convenience! And we were close to everything. beaches. restaurants. caf√©s.........It was just a pleasant stay from beginning to end. We will definitely stay at the Boarding house again.
9677681,Frank,March,2018,I would highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to Rincon. Vanessa and Greg were excellent hosts. They were very welcoming and knowledgeable of the area. The location is ideal and top deck is incredible. Would definitely stay here again!
9677681,Victor And Maria,March,2018,The views more than make up for the lack of adequate parking space. But then again this is Puntas. That is the trade off with most of the places there. it being a rural community and all. We didn't get to meet Vanessa since she was out of town but Greg made himself available and was a gracious host.Overall we enjoyed our stay very much.
9677681,Frank,February,2018,Honestly best decision we made was staying with Vanessa and Greg. They were everything we could have asked for super sweet and very knowledgeable with the area. Every morning we talked to them about the plans we had and were able to point us in the perfect direction whether it was for food. drinks. and even safe areas to get in for surfing. Their house is located in a perfect spot in my opinion (surfer/food junkie). It was centrally located between two surf spots and several surf shops as well. Amazing food was only a 2 min drive down the road and several good bars as well. As for the accommodations we couldn't have asked for a more beautiful home to stay at. It was super clean and very welcoming with an amazing rooftop view of sandy beach. This is an amazing house and a no brainer to stay at! We are looking forward to coming back and staying with them next time.
9677681,Sandra,March,2017,Nice. clean. comfortable and centric. Great deck upstairs.  you going to love the view from there.
9677681,Mary,March,2017,This place is spectacular! Very clean. very comfortable. I first hesitated because I felt it wasn't close to the beach. but now I am so glad I stayed there. The location in Rincon is great. close to restaurants and shops and really not too far from the beach. Vanessa provided beach towels. chairs and  a cooler. There are several good beaches close by. The view from the roof top is unbelievable - day or night. Went up there first thing in the morning(with coffee provided by Vanessa every morning) and then again in the evening after returning from our day. So nice to relax and star gaze. Took a day trip down to Cabo Rojo(about one hour by car) and it was so worth it to visit the lighthouse and the nearby beach. It is not to be missed! Vanessa communicated very well. before and during our trip. Very easy to find with GPS and check in was a breeze. I am definitely coming back here and highly recommend it to anyone traveling to this area of Puerto Rico.
9677681,Response from Vanessa,April,2016,I'm so glad that you enjoyed your time here Mae. Good for you guys for walking down to sandy beach! That can be a tough hike for people. Come back and visit soon!!
9677681,Nannette,January,2022,If you are looking for a place to relax this is the right place. Super quiet. everything was clean and organized. It is close to everything so it is ideal to get to know the attractions of Rincon. The terrace is an oasis of peace. Communication was excellent and the process was super fast. Everything is as described.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

15830826,Jason,November,2022,Excellent stay. clean. spacious and  great location in Puntas near Sandy Beach. and the pool was great for the kids. Ines was an excellent host and communicated everything proactively with us and answered all our questions within minutes. Highly recommend!
15830826,Matthew,October,2022,Perfect location. 2 blocks to the beach. Everything you need for the beach. chairs. umbrella and cooler. Sandy beach is my favorite place to visit in PR. Adam and Ines made the stay amazing helping whenever we needed anything. Already counting down the days until we can come back.
15830826,Octavio,July,2022,Great place. great communication. The hosts shows interest in the guest accomodations. The apartment has all a family needs for vacation. Higy recommended.

15830826,Shane,June,2022,Great place to stay!  Location and amenities were perfect for family of 6.
15830826,David,May,2022,Great spot.  Close to everything in the Sandy Beach area.  The airbnb website doesn't have a scale so you don't get a feel for distance.  It is close to everything.  Quick walk to anything you need.
15830826,Jody,April,2022,Excellent host. Host went above and beyond with communication and kindness. We had a cancelled flight and the host allowed us to stay overnight until our next flight. The apt. was as described - clean and comfortable and in a great location so you could walk to area restaurants. a mini-market. a yoga studio. and an amazing beach.
15830826,Max,April,2022,This was a great location and great layout for a fun week!
15830826,Aynex,December,2021,Stay here!Wonderful place and host. If you surf the quiver offers a great selection without having to shop around for a rental. They even put the rack on the car for us!The house was clean and comfortable. Each room has its own AC and the kitchen had everything we needed. and more.The place is accesible for people with mobility concerns. The area has a lot to offer. shops. restaurants. bars. sightseeing. snorkeling. and surf. The area had a lot of tourists and feels more amaricono then Puerto Rican. Tu no habl√≥ espa√±ol. no problemitas.
15830826,Gloria,October,2021,Beautiful apartment s√∫per host!!
15830826,Carmen,September,2021,Nice location near Sandy Beach.Well-kept and spacious apt. Excellent communication from the hosts. Kitchen fully equipped and clean. We enjoy our stay.
15830826,Sarah,August,2021,Great location! One block from a beautiful beach that was almost empty of other people the week we were there. Ines the property manager was an excellent communicator and responded quickly to any and all questions. Adam provided an extensive list of restaurants. surf spots and non-surf activities nearby. It‚Äôs also an easy home base to explore the whole west side of the island. We hiked to waterfalls. went kayaking in mangroves and swimming in the bioluminescent bay all within 1.5 hrs drive from the condo. The pool is also a nice amenity especially if traveling with younger kids. There is ample parking. Plenty big for our party of seven minivan. The space could also fit two compact cars instead. It‚Äôs such a beautiful area. We‚Äôll be back for sure!!
15830826,Cathy,July,2021,Very nice place. Highly recommended!
15830826,Erica,July,2021,Great place to stay in Rinc√≥n.

15830826,Alexandra,June,2021,A fabulous location a block from the beach. We can‚Äôt say enough about Ines and her recommendations. she truly was a great host and made all the difference! The place was clean and comfortable. Highly recommend for a relaxing stay in Rincon!
15830826,Daniel,May,2021,The location of this place could not be any better for surfing + super nice and helpful host. Great experience overall.
15830826,Response from Adam,May,2021,"Jennifer ""Lovinlife"" is a scammer.  I have over 600 reviews on ten properties. she has zero.  To suggest she was being racially profiled is disgusting. laughable and a lie.  Please look at my reviews and see the diversity of my guests over the last few years. and the consistently great reviews as to how well they were treated.  I am totally color blind and we welcome everyone with equally open arms and enthusiasm regardless of race. religion. gender or sexual orientation.      As far as Jennifer's claimed ""invasion of privacy."" it never happened.  Here is what did happen. For the first three days of her stay. Jennifer and my property manager had very good exchanges and Jennifer expressed how pleased she was with everything.  On day four there was an injury and my property manager asked Jennifer's mother. who was sitting on the deck in front of the condo  if she can enter the apartment accompanied in order to get into the locked owner's closet where there was first aid kit and other supplies.  She did not know if the person was Jennifer or one of the supposedly ""6"" other guests authorized to stay there. but she did know she was one of the guests because she had seen her there the three previous days. Jennifer's mother was happy to escort my property manager into the home to the locked closet to get the first aid kit. was extremely nice. and in five minutes the property manager was in and out. thanked the mom for letting her in and that was the ""invasion.""   Jennifer called me shortly after screaming that her ""privacy was invaded.""  I asked how and she said my property manager entered the apartment illegally.  I explained that the property manager asked the Airbnb guest sitting on the deck if she could enter the apartment accompanied and the person said yes.  Jennifer claimed that because the booking was under her name. she is the only one that could grant permission.  I said that is not actually true. but we want all of our guests to be happy and I asked what would make her happy.  She said compensation.  I asked Jennifer how much compensation she deserved for her mother granting permission to my property manager entering the home for 5 minutes in order to get a first aid kit and other supplies.  She hung up on me.   I called her back and said Jennifer. what are you looking for. she said money and if I didn't pay her. she would write a the worst review ever.  I questioned why she would do that given she had been saying how much she loved the property. she said because she could.  I said then I will write a bad review for her trying to extort money for nothing and she will not be able to rent again. to which she responded ""there are ways to get around that. I have done it before.""   After the call. I clicked on her profile and I noticed zero reviews and a last name ""Lovinlife.""  I called AirBnb and explained the situation and that a guest was trying to blackmail me into paying her in exchange for her not writing a fictitious review. The   AirBnb representative assured me that she would not be allowed to write a review and they would monitor it. Air Bnb then published her bogus review despite the assurances to the contrary.   Later that day I got a call from the condo manager who told me I was violating condo rules by allowing 9 people to stay in the unit.  My property manager went to the pool and confirmed to me that Jennifer had 9 guests staying at the unit. not 7.  My limit is 6. and I will allow 7 for a $25 day fee.  Jennifer had said they were 7.  I called Jennifer and said that we agreed to allow 7. I am not allowed to have 9. but I did not want to kick them out with two nights to go. but she would have to pay the $25 fee per extra person per day--which she had paid for guest number 7.  .  I also said instead of charging $250 for two extra people for 5 nights. I would only charge $200. because she was upset about the approved 5 minute visit.  She refused to pay and stated that she would just tell AirBnb the extra guests were just visiting for the day.   When she was checking out and my property manager saw all 9 people were in the parking lot. I asked her to take a picture. in case Air Bnb required proof.  She started to take a picture and Jennifer's party started to chase her and she ran fearing for her safety without getting a picture.   I filed a claim for the extra people. and AirBnB said that Jennifer denied the extra guests stayed there and that I needed to provide a picture. which we did not have.  We then went to clean the apartment and discovered Jennifer's party had purposely carved into two pieces of wooden furniture. stained two sets of sheets beyond repair and broke a beach umbrella in half.  I filed another claim. this time with pictures and evidence. but still have not heard from AirBnb.    I have been a super host for four straight years.  Until this review. my rating with over 600 reviews on ten rentals was over 4.9.  We pride ourselves on offering a stay experience that exceeds expectations. a super clean house. lot's of free goodies. and an exceptional guest experience.   AirBnb failed to protect me as a host from a predatorial guest who was looking to extort money for nothing. who in fact was breaking the rules. avoiding charges she owed and they purposely destroyed property.   This guest checked in under a fictitious name and has zero reviews.  Hopefully future guests can see through her lies. even if AirBnb was spineless and failed to act in a responsible manner with respect to me. despite  having all the facts during her stay.  I suppose one bad able in 600 stays is not terrible. but man this one hurt and I hope future guests see through this one lie of a review. AdamShow more"

15830826,Manal,April,2021,Adams place was sparkling clean. We had an amazing experience. Enis was a great host always assisting us with recommendations and any questions we had.

15830826,Tania,December,2020,This was our second time renting an apartment in this complex.  The building itself is in a great location and has a nice little pool area shared by 6 apartments which was never crowded.  Adam and Ines were great hosts - very accommodating and responsive.  The apartment is fully furnished and the kitchen had everything we needed to cook.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because there was no hot water in one of the bathroom showers (hot water would come on/off while showering) and some of the furniture. kitchen equipment and bedding could use a refresh.  Other than that. the apartment was sparkling clean and I would definitely stay there again.
15830826,Alejandro,October,2020,This was a great apartment on an excellent area in Rinc√≥n. The place was beautiful. super clean and everything worked perfectly. It has great pool area too. Sandy beach. Tamboo bar and Kahuna Burger are a few minutes walk from the apartment. And some other places like Beach House.

15830826,Silka,September,2019,Adam was incredible through the whole process. we had a little hiccup with the WiFi and it was resolved in no time. Adam‚Äôs place is clean. conveniently located and super comfortable and the pool is well kept; my children who are 18.15 and 8 all enjoyed it. He had great recommendations for local stuff (restaurants. beaches. shopping). check in was a breeze and check out was too. My mom left behind a hand knit poncho and I wrote him as soon as we noticed and once again we got a quick response and he had no problem mailing it back home to us. Once again Adam thank you on behalf of my family and myself. If we‚Äôre ever back in Rincon we won‚Äôt hesitate to go back to Adam‚Äôs place.
15830826,Sylvette,September,2019,Nice apartment with a wonderful location near the beach and a lot of great restaurants and bars. The building also has a power generator. Adam is an excellent host that takes care of every detail. I recommend it 100%!!!

15830826,Cheryl,July,2019,This was the cleanest Airbnb I have ever stayed at. There were enough towels for the beach  and the shower. There was everything you needed for the beach. including sunscreen. chairs. boogie boards. snorkel gear etc.. There is a washer and dryer. There was a cooler and bag of ice in the freezer. I don‚Äôt think you could ask for a better condo.The pool was  right outside our door.  The pool was clean and a very nice temperature. The beach was a very short walk. it was beautiful! We found many shells and sea glass! Close to restaurants. shops. Many you can walk to. But if you need more it‚Äôs about a 10 minute drive to Rincon. It‚Äôs a very scenic area. Beautiful sunsets! Friendly people. We never felt unsafe.  I love Rincon area. There is much to do.  We snorkeled at Steps beach. went to farmers market. shopped in Rincon. saw the Lighthouse.  ate at fabulous restaurants.  and enjoyed the beach.  You won‚Äôt regret renting this Airbnb.  Adam has set very high standards!  He is a model host.  I can‚Äôt wait to go back to Rincon!
15830826,Tony,July,2019,Lots of space and comfort and even the pool is on front and 2 streets away the beach.
15830826,Juan,June,2019,The place is immaculate. lovely and extremely comfortable. The pool area is spot on. It‚Äôs close to everything you‚Äôll need: convenience store. restaurants. beach. Adam is a host that has an eye for attention to details and making sure that you get the best experience possible.

22688087,Diana,December,2022,Amazing location. right in the water.
22688087,Sidney,November,2022,Had a great time. beautiful location and very convenient.  Family had an excellent time.
22688087,Darin,October,2022,Great location.  Music from Tamboo and another establishment can be noisy on the weekends.  but minor inconvenience.  Location and attentiveness from owners was topnotch.  We will be back.
22688087,Merry,October,2022,An absolute must stay in Rincon! We never wanted to leave. This property. view. and location are all breathtaking. The beach is a tucked away corner of paradise where you can relax with a book all day long. Also a great place to watch the sunrise. The house itself looks exactly like the pictures. Clean. modern. but quaint enough that it feels like home. We opened the windows most of the time. but the AC does wonders when you need it to. The outdoor shower was a god send to wash the sand off when returning from the beach. I spent a lot of time on the outdoor deck reading and watching the waves. For authentic. amazing Puerto Rican food. the Red Flamboyan is a quick drive up the hill. We ate there multiple times. Tamboo and the Beach House both have good food and amazing views. The Juice Bar at Black Eagle Beach had great juice and acai bowls. There are so many beautiful beaches and great restaurants within a 10 minute drive. Check in was a breeze and the gated parking made us feel safe and secure. The house has a fully equipped kitchen and provided bug spray which came in handy. If we had any questions. or a quick can of raid. Wesley is a text away. You are in the jungle. so there will be occasional pests. It just adds to the charm :)  Cannot recommend this property more! We will definitely be back.Show more
22688087,Robin,August,2022,We loved this place! Easily one of the nicest places in PR. The location was awesome. The town of Rincon was cool. great people. The house was as advertised and had everything that we needed. The sandy beach made the whole trip. Can‚Äôt wait to come back! Thank you for letting us stay with you!
22688087,Clara,August,2022,We had an amazing stay. The location is just beautiful and everything is made to make you feel comfortable. The beach in front of the place is really pretty and it felt really nice to just walk a few steps to catch a sunset on the sand. The morning coffee on the outside patio looking at the water was so nice as well. The only thing I would mention is the the bar/restaurant located a block behind is playing loud music until 1am so earplugs were necessary for me to sleep. Will be back!
22688087,Katie,July,2022,This house exceeded our expectations! Beautiful beach access and great location to visit local attractions. The house was fantastic with everything we needed! Thanks for an excellent memory!
22688087,Jennifer,June,2022,The rental was exactly as the pictures showed and we absolutely loved it.  I gave them 5 stars all the way through but I do want to mention (through no fault of their own) that the Big Kahuna restaurant   which is about 1 block from the rental has a deejay on Friday  nights (maybe Saturday too. not sure) and it BLASTS club type music with bass beats till about 1am which cannot be drowned out in either bedroom.  We had a wonderful stay and it was quiet and relaxing until that incident on Friday night.  If you have little kids/babies I can see that might be a problem.  Also. the restaurant 3 doors down on the beach called Tamboo was only open Thurs-Sun from 1pm-last seating at 8pm.  Again that is totally out of the control of the Airbnb rental but wanted to mention it.  We ate most nights at The Beach House just down the road.  Also. the wave breaks are very powerful and strong on this beach - you have to swim out past them about 50 yards or else you'll get pummeled.  So if you have little kiddos. Sandy Beach may not be the best for them.    It was PERFECT for my 21 yr old daughter and I and I would stay there again.   The washroom has all the beach toys you'll need (chairs. umbrella. coolers. fins/goggles/snorkels etc) and there are 2 washers and 2 dryers so you never have to wait for your downstairs neighbors laundry to finish.  Our favorite spot was sitting on the covered patio in the mornings eating breakfast and while watching the waves.  PS - the outdoor shower has hot water!!!  What a surprise and so nice!!Show more
22688087,Anna,June,2022,This is the place to stay! Right on the beach with all the amenities you need to have a perfect adventure. We did a sister‚Äôs trip here and having that view every morning with the sounds of the waves was exactly what we needed for a relaxing vacation. The beach in front (sandy beach) was ideal for taking sunrise strolls and catching some waves on the provided boogie boards. Jack‚Äôs food truck and Tamboo were excellent options to eat at and all with in walking distance. Oh and there is a really nice snorkeling beach just 10 mins away. steps beach-lots of fish.I will definitely come back here and stay.
22688087,Yas,January,2022,Dream is real! The place was fantastic. Very clean and stylish with everything you needed. In a great location. literately right on a beach! Shawn was very accommodating and helpful letting us drop our bags off early and checking in on us regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again!
22688087,Karen,January,2022,Great place! My fianc√© and I go every year! A true treasure
22688087,Niamh,January,2022,Smashing location. Great for a family.  Idiic during Covid Outbreak. Surf intense at times especially with undercurrent. Locals very welcoming -  restaurants easily accessed.
22688087,Lee,January,2022,This home is wonderful and well equipped.  We had a great stay!The location was great
22688087,Mike,December,2021,It was as advertised. A beautiful setting on the ocean. Walking distance to two great restaurants and another bar. And a coffee shop in the morning. We saw people surfing right out front every morning. Everyone we encountered in the area was very nice. A short drive to Rincon and the art walk on Thursday
22688087,Minnie,November,2021,Love the property and the location. Rooms and bathrooms were cleaned and nicely decorated. A/C worked well. The upper terrace was the best spot in the house. We enjoy many hours just sitting there feeling the breeze and listening to the ocean waves. The lower deck is an extra bonus to sit and relax. The kitchen has everything needed to fully cook but sometimes going out to local restaurants is a must do. I fully recommend it.
22688087,Brianna,November,2021,Great location and a great host! Would stay there again for sure
22688087,Alexander,November,2021,Great location and beautiful home. Right on the beach. clean and well taken care of home. Would come back in an instant!
22688087,Jade,September,2021,We loved the location. Gorgeous view and convenient access. Beach view was exactly as shown in the pictures. Comfortable beds and cold AC blowing for each bedroom. The housemates below were kind and we shared the space easily with them.
22688087,Amanda,August,2021,The airbnb is really nice. It had everything we needed from towels to cleaning supplies and more! We loved that we could wake up and be on the beach. The deck is a nice plus so you can relax and watch the waves or even sit and have breakfast. The beds were comfy and the house is spacious enough for 4 people. Everything is close by such as restaurants. souvenirs. the beach. gas stations. and excursions. The area is safe so walking places was no issue. But when out beware of the mosquitoes. Bring bug spray or those little repellent bracelets. We went to 3 restaurants during our stay: the Red Flamboyan which we didn‚Äôt have a good experience and the food was blah. We went to The Beach house which has amazing food and drinks! We went twice and they didn‚Äôt disappoint. We ate at Tamboo which is right next door to the Airbnb. The menu selection is small but the food is delicious and the service is amazing! We had a few issues like a power outage but there was a generator. Little ants come out for sweets. trash and food so get a can of raid. Shout out to Wesley who is the point of contact there. He came right over when we had an issue and helped us out. Super friendly and responsive! Overall. we enjoyed our trip and would recommend staying here.
22688087,MariaCristina,August,2021,Our family rented in the upstairs unit and truly enjoyed our stay!  We were 3 adults and two 9-11 yr olds.  The beachfront location made it easy for the kids to play and enjoy the ocean while the adults could relax on the terrace.  The unit was clean. well appointed and very comfortable.  We look forward to returning!
22688087,Jessica,May,2021,My boyfriend and I stayed at Shawn's upstairs Airbnb and words cannot describe how lucky we felt to have chosen this place. Waking up and walking out to our balcony overlooking the beach was such a treat. The place was exactly as pictured. clean. comfortable. right by Tamboo and Red Flamboyant... couldn't have asked for more. He even has beach chairs. snorkeling gear. and other beach toys in the garage for us. Check-in was also super smooth. Highly recommend!
22688087,Matt,May,2021,We loved our stay here! We woke up each morning and went straight to the beach. which was relatively private and a perfect place to swim. The house is cozy and inviting and made for a wonderful space to relax after a day adventuring in the sun. Everything was clean. with extra items available to us such as shampoo/soap/conditioner. beach toys. and laundry facilities. Make sure you walk down to the Wandering Bagel for breakfast during your stay!
22688087,Gina,February,2021,Loved our stay great place great vibes
22688087,Denise,February,2021,We could say so much. but I will try to keep it short.  The location. residence. beach. local atmosphere and locals were amazing.  We were extremely happy with our stay. as were our 20ish age children!  We found we didn't want to venture out much as the location was perfect for our intended vacation!
22688087,Mackenzie,January,2021,True to photos. a great spot on Sandy Beach. We have stayed in this neighborhood several times and this is our favorite rental so far. We loved being right on the beach. the great views. and appreciated the snorkel equipment and beach chairs. The mattresses were comfortable. plenty of towels/washcloths. beach towels and board games. and higher-quality AC units (loved the feature to turn the AC light off at night). We took every covid precaution we could and quarantined before our trip. We felt very safe with our airline and in general Puerto Rico‚Äôs handling of things and are glad we still went. PR is much better about sanitizing. temp checks. and masking than our hometown. Can‚Äôt wait to be back!
22688087,Jose Arturo,January,2021,Perfect place at Sandy Beach.   Second time for us.   Will definitely be back. Thanks
22688087,Rhonda,January,2021,This place was terrific. Has pretty much everything you need. a deck and is right on the beach. There a few local restaurants. Of course with covid times posted on their websites are not accurate so just a heads up. There are also a few local mini gift shops. Rinc√≥n is a cool little place to explore too. Ir just to sit on the beach and watch the surfers and the waves.
22688087,Yahaira,December,2020,Beautiful place with beautiful views. Space enough for vacation with the necessary amenities. Great spot. Would definitely come back when possible.
22688087,Tanya,December,2020,The space was nice but is in need of some Major TLC in areas that can be easily taken care of.Deck and Porch were amazing along with the view!
22688087,Michele,November,2020,Shawn‚Äôs place is absolutely perfect and the location is amazing! We stayed here for our honeymoon and had the best time. The beach is beautiful. it‚Äôs close to so many things to do and the restaurants in the area/walking distance are fabulous. The kitchen is stocked with everything you need and the shampoo/conditioner/shower gel in the bathrooms were nice amenities! We would definitely rent here again!
22688087,Jose Arturo,November,2020,The place is just perfect.   Best beach in Rinc√≥n.  good waves for surfing üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  super clean.  all the beach goodies you will need and great communication with owners. Already planning to go back next year.   Thanks for hosting us ü§ô
22688087,Jessica,October,2020,Awesome place in front of the beach !! Clean and nice location!
22688087,Gilberto,October,2020,Shawn was an amazing host and Wesley was a great help with our stay when we had any questions or issues. The view is absolutely amazing. every morning  my family and I were able to hang out on the deck. hearing the waves crashing on the beach behind us. Will definitely stay again next time we come to visit. 10/10!!
22688087,Yarinel,October,2020,everything was perfect.
22688087,Gamaliel,August,2020,It was a awesome place to vacation. I recommend to anyone that wants to go vacation Puerto Rico.
22688087,Rosa,July,2020,The place inside is nice but the deck is for sharing not a couple!!. we have to share with 4 smoking people so we couldn‚Äôt even seat there ! With the COVID issue is not safe !The beach is rough! Not for family with small kids .The second floor is clean with a good balcony
22688087,Karina,July,2020,The house was great! Right on the beach. Amazing views. It's small but has absolutely everything you need. The bedrooms are good sized. Nice bed sheets and decor. Perfect for an easy family vacation. We were able to see baby leatherback turtles going to sea right from the deck. We will be back.
22688087,Jennifer,March,2020,Sandy Beach Paradise was excellent.  The location was perfect.  The space was amazing and all our needs were met. We had a fabulous visit.
22688087,Liz,December,2019,We spent Christmas in paradise. It was a great space for our family of four. View was to die for. space was clean and had everything we needed. We are looking forward to returning.
22688087,Linda,November,2019,Everything you need and nothing you don't need:  contemporary style decor in seashore colors; floor to ceiling immaculately clean home; totally comfortable furnishings; gleaming appliances. The upper deck and ground level deck include plenty of comfy furniture for al fresco dining or lounging under shade or sun.  Outdoor shower and available garden hoses for washing off sand and salt. And always. the sound of the ocean waves meeting the beach
22688087,Jenefer,June,2019,Was such a beautiful place & location with all the amenities you need. close to everything & very safe. all the detailed information was perfect as well. Definitely Paradise! Stay here you‚Äôll be very happy you did!

17666821,Response from Rebecca And Manuel,June,2022,Hi Xiao. yes the house is from the 1970' s it might be outdated but it is very clean. You definitely did not read the listing. This is my house in which you stayed .  If you want a luxury hotel or a luxurious Airbnb I suggest next time you book one. and read thoroughly the description because obviously you did not read the description of my house.Show more
17666821,Eliezer,June,2022,We loved our stay. everything we needed was available and more. the kayaks where a plus. the beach was walking distance through a nice nature trail. Rebecca and Manuel gave us some insight on places we haven‚Äôt visited before in Rinc√≥n. Highly recommended!
17666821,Response from Rebecca And Manuel,June,2022,I am so sorry you feel that way. Do not mix cleanliness with outdated . It us an old house and it has the usual everyday wear and tear. As advertised this is not a luxury hotel. As advertised it has air conditioners only in the bedrooms and ceiling fans in the living room.  dining room and kitchen. I can not control the weather or the temperature.  It is hot on a tropical island.  As advertised. yes. there is an amazing swimming Beach just 3 minutes walking distance.Show more
17666821,Sarah,June,2022,Great place. felt comfortable. and lots of supplies for beach going. and enjoying the area. The owners are very responsive and easy to chat with. We had to leave unexpectedly due to illness and they assisted in making our departure easy and stress free.
17666821,Kanchan,May,2022,Rebecca and Manual are wonderful hosts! They are super-friendly. always available if anything was needed. and caring. Their hospitality made our stay so pleasant. If we revisit the area we'll definitely want to stay at one of their properties for sure!
17666821,Laura,May,2022,DREAMY PERFECT PLACE!!!!! The pictures hardly do this place justice. The house was spacious. sparkling clean. and had everything we needed. There were plenty of towels for the beach. beach chairs. snorkel gear and kayaks. The beach is at the end of the block and opens onto a sandy beach with palm trees and a calm ocean that is perfect for swimming and floating around. There is also a little bar restaurant with nice snack food and drinks. I cannot overstate how AMAZING our hosts were!! They truly are SUPERHOSTS. One of our friends in the group had a medical event that required calling the medics to assess her. Rebecca and Manuel. our hosts. were nearby and saw the ambulance at our Airbnb. They came right over and thankfully were able to translate with the medics as we did not speak Spanish and the medics did not speak English. That would‚Äôve been enough to rate them as super hosts but they went even further. Manuel went to town and got soup broth and Gatorade for our friend. They offered to go with us to the clinic. They checked up on us later in the day. And most importantly. they were so warm. caring and nurturing which made what was a slightly scary experience feel more manageable. (Our friend was ok and turns out was having an allergy reaction). The hosts also graciously allowed us to keep our bags at the place on our last day so that we could go to the beach one last time. And as far as Rincon the town - it‚Äôs just a minute drive or so and has wonderful cafes and restaurants and shops. I found some awesome rings at one of the stores. If you have not been to Rincon. you won‚Äôt be disappointed if you love a quiet. tranquil and beautiful place. And Rebecca and Manuel are truly so responsive to any question I had before and throughout our stay. Their warmth is world class! We all are already planning our next trip back to this house!Show more
17666821,Janiele,May,2022,Exactly as described!! Close walk to the beach and comfortable beds to sleep in. We had so much fun kayaking and exploring. Rebecca and Manuel we're excellent host and responded instantly when we need directions. Thank you so muchüòÑWe will be back!!
17666821,Allison,May,2022,Superb location and accommodates 6 people comfortably. 1 week stay with 4 people cuts the allotment of two rolls of toilet paper pretty close. Plan on getting an extra roll. Beds are firm but bedding and linens are nice. AC in bedrooms are clutch. Early morning barking from neighbor‚Äôs dog wasn‚Äôt drowned out by the fan of the AC unit. Took some getting use to. Amenities. tous. beach towels for the beach were invaluable. Kitchen stocked with all the tools necessary to cook up meals if you want to eat in. A pretty great place to stay! Hosts are very friendly and helpful!

The neighborhood is 100% safe and all the neighbors are very friendly. We were walking distance to the beach so if that's your goal this is the place. We also walked to a coffee shop. burger food truck and main public beach and surrounding restaurants. At night it is so quiet you only hear coquies singing. The house has plenty of room and beds. We absolutely recommend this house.

17666821,Todd,May,2021,We can‚Äôt say enough about our stay!  It is a little tucked away spot with perfect proximity to the beach. There are ton of restaurants within walking distance and plenty to do in and around Rincon.  In short. it will provide you with the vacation you are looking for!The house is great with two outdoor sitting areas and plenty of room inside.  We brought our family of four and it was very spacious.  It‚Äôs also on a quiet street with a small park across the way‚Ä¶ it worked really well with our toddler and infant. Most importantly. Rebecca and Manny are excellent hosts.  They stopped by to make sure we were settled. and gave us some suggestions of what to do.  They are very good people and are members of the community where the Airbnb is located.  They are also very respectful of your space‚Ä¶ they are like a great hotel concierge! We will stay there again the next time we go to Rincon!

17666821,Barry,March,2021,Perfect place in paradise! Great chill. family-friendly neighborhood with easy access to THE snorkel spot in Rincon and the wonderfully calm Marina Beach. Location is central to everything. Close enough to town and to surf spots. but just far enough to feel secluded.   Showers were hot. washer/dryer worked great. AC kept bedrooms nice and cool and fans throughout the house kept everything else comfortable. Two outdoor spaces were a big plus. It was more than enough home for our family of 4. We had EVERYTHING we needed. We're ready to live there! Manuel and Becky are truly SUPER hosts. So attentive and communicative. We felt like they really cared about us and our experience in Rincon. We HIGHLY recommend this home.
17666821,Michelle,March,2021,The townhouse is very nice and in a great location. I highly recommend
17666821,Laura,March,2021,Manual and Rebecca‚Äôs home served as the most incredible home away from home for us. The location cannot be beat - a two minute walk to the beach and a close walk to the Marina. all the while on a quiet street and close to such friendly neighbors. Manual and Rebecca were always accessible. responsive. and not to mention just lovely people that we now consider our friends. Can‚Äôt wait to come back and stay here again!
17666821,Natalie,January,2021,First off. this place exceeded our expectations in every way. The home was spacious and offered everything we needed: ample space for outdoor hangouts. kitchen had all the amenities we needed for cooking. the large dining table was a perfect work space. the outdoor grill got much use. and the living room was a great place for late night movie. We were able to WFH here for the month with no issues. The home came with snorkel gear and two kayaks. which we got great use out of! The reef directly in front of the private beach outlet is amazing - we highly recommend checking it out! There was also sandcastle gear and other beach toys offered if you're looking to feed your inner child. The beach was a close 2 min walk away through a nature path. There is a little park across the street that offered a great view in the front yard. The neighborhood is full of amazing people each who were kinder than the next. We felt very safe in this neighborhood. even walking alone at night. The downtown is a short 10 minute walk away with great restaurants. shops. and many popups from local artists and vendors. There is two grocery stores and an organic food market within a short 5 minute drive which was beyond convenient for all our cooking needs. Surfing beaches like Domes and Maria are also a quick 5 minute drive away.Rebecca and Manuel were amazing hosts. and offered to share their beautiful home of Puerto Rico.  the local food. and culture with us. They took us to explore the mangroves in La Parguera on the southwest side of the island. which was such a fun and beautiful experience. I will also take a moment to brag about their cooking skills. as we have never had more delicious mofongos in our life!Show more
17666821,Zahira,January,2021,Walking distance to the beach. very comfy and nice space.
17666821,Mike,December,2020,Great location! 1 mile walk to the Econo grocery store. 2 minute walk to a beautiful swimming beach. Short walk to downtown and local restaurants.  1.5 miles to Maria‚Äôs surfing beach. We will definitely stay here again. Manuel and Rebecca were very attentive hosts and went above and beyond!
17666821,Hayley,December,2020,Beautiful home. we loved our stay!
17666821,Carlos,November,2020,Rebecca & Manuel are super hosts and their cozy beach town house in Rinc√≥n was just perfect. We all agreed that it felt like home. so tidy. clean and warm. We enjoyed much needed family time in their wonderful terrace in the back and had the best time at the beach. Every little detail was thought of and they were always available for everything we needed. Thank you for your flexibility and guidance. Beautiful beaches are within a short 5 min walk or a very short ride and Rinc√≥n‚Äôs main stream is so close. We loved our time in your home. Thank you so much for helping us create wonderful memories.
17666821,Ingrid,November,2020,The hosts are super helpful and respond quickly to questions. This home is close to everything and as they state it is literally steps from the beach. The home has a beautiful patio with a grill!  Highly recommended!
17666821,Mary,November,2020,We enjoyed having the added space that this house offered. We watched TV in the living room and played games on the large dining room table. The bedrooms were spacious and comfortable. We could walk to the beach as well as restaurants in the area. The neighborhood is quiet.
17666821,Dominique,November,2020,Me. my sister and our three friends had such a beautiful two weeks stay at Rebecca and Manuel‚Äôs place. The place itself felt so cozy. it was super clean. had all the amenities needed to be incredibly comfortable (extra sheets. towels. pots pans to cook. coffee machine. wine glasses. etc.) the backyard and upstairs balcony were so beautiful. especially at night to watch the stars and listen to all the sounds of nature. It was like a dream home. Rebecca and Manuel even provide two kayaks and snorkeling gear free of charge. They were always so quick to respond any time we reached out. Our friend had swimmers ear and they helped us to get him antibiotics to assist with his pain. The location was central to town. about 10-15 minutes walking (we skated a lot which made it quicker) 5 minutes walk to two food trucks which had the best a√ßa√≠ bowls. espresso and most delicious burritos!) About three minutes from the house is this pristine. almost private beach you can walk to through a majestic little piece of jungle to get to. Neighbors all around were so kind. Felt so safe and welcomed. like we were all friends or even family. Only thing is. if you are looking to surf and don‚Äôt have a car. it takes a half an hour or so to get to the good surf beaches like Maria‚Äôs. indicators. domes etc. but if your lucky (we had one or two days) you can surf little Malibu which is right next to the private beach (like 5 minutes from the house). And if you have a car it‚Äôs only a quick 10 minute drive or so to great surf breaks. All in all it was an exceptional stay and we‚Äôd all love to come back one day. Thank you endlessly Rebecca and Manuel.Show more
17666821,Maia,October,2020,Absolutely perfect experience. We loved taking the little walk through the jungle to the beach. playing basketball across the street. lounging in the yard with the grill. and relaxing in the breezy house. Becky and Manuel are the kindest hosts. I strongly recommend this spot. I stayed almost two weeks but I wish it was even longer.
17666821,Charlie,August,2020,Rebecca and Manuel are wonderful hosts and their rental is a great space that's only a short walk to a perfect little beach. There are two excellent outdoor spaces where you can janguear and grill out or just take in the stars. Definitely recommend this one for your next stay in Rincon!

17666821,Meg,January,2020,Manuel and Becky couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Their place is comfortable w/great beds and dependable fans and air conditioning. The back patio with grill is charming. It worked great for our family of 5 to be able to walk the 3 minutes to the beach whenever each of us was ready. Manuel and Becky helped us arrange a surfing lesson for two of our kids and gave us lots of tips about both Rincon and San Juan.

The beach was really close and the kitchen was fully equipped. which was a big plus. Our only issue was with one of the rooms; when it rained on the second day we stayed there. the roof started to leak excessively. making it unable to sleep in that room. Apart from that. everything was perfect and we would stay there when we‚Äôre back in Rinc√≥n.
17666821,Mari,August,2019,Always is a pleasure to stay on your property! Thank you very much.
17666821,Teresa,July,2019,Homey feeling and only a block away from the beach. Three blocks away from harbor house rest that has great food and good drink prices.

17666821,Gabriela Enid,July,2019,Rebecca and Manuel where great hosts! They were very kind and eager to show us around. The house was perfect. the bbq was a hit and it was very clean. We had everything we needed in the house such as kitchen and bbq utensils. bed sheets. soap. shampoo. bug spray. etc. The walk to the beach is very short and there is a small mall with a supermarket just a 2 min drive from the apartment. I would definitely book this apartment again.

17666821,Rachel,April,2019,Rebecca and Manuel were great hosts! The home was in a good location although you can not see the beach from the home it is a short walk to the beach. We had an issue with upstairs shower but the hosts were very thoughtful and apologetic. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome and gave us good info on local places to eat and rent from. We loved Rincon and can‚Äôt wait to visit that area again! You definitely felt like a local in this location so the experience was even better for us. It was a little warm downstairs because the only AC is upstairs in bedrooms but surprisingly we acclimated well.
17666821,Mari,April,2019,Excellent location!
17666821,Dahima,March,2019,great hosts! the location is amazing. just a short walk away from the beach and town square. Cant wait to go back.
17666821,Shannon,March,2019,Great family friendly place in the perfect location!  You can tell that Rebecca and Manuel take a lot of care to make sure their guests have everything they need.  They responded very quickly and checked up on us during our stay.  It was the perfect location and walkable to the best hings that Rincon has to offer.
17666821,Gabi,March,2019,Gorgeous little house in a super convenient space. Literally my only complaint is we were never able to get the hot water running in the showers which was a bit uncomfortable but nothing out of this world. Rebecca and Manuel were kind. and quick to respond to any questions I had. We had a blast and would definitely consider staying here again.
17666821,Annette,March,2019,Rebecca a a Manual were awesome. Will come back again
17666821,Meg,March,2019,There were 4 of us. all college students. on sprig break. Rebecca and Manuel were awesome suggesting things for us to do. We will definitely return again as it is a beautiful location
17666821,Joanmarie,March,2019,Becky and Manuel are great! Their suggestion for renting boats out in La Parguera was spot on. They showed us a short cut to the beach that was within a 2 minute walk and they are super responsive. They‚Äôre great!
17666821,Christopher,March,2019,Great experience dealing with Rebecca and Manuel. Will be renting from them again in November.
17666821,Danielle,February,2019,This house is located in a prime area to explore the northern and southern parts of Rincon. (Also about 35 min to Crashboat beach in Aguadilla). You can also walk to areas to eat. as well as take a safe 10 min walk to downtown Rincon. This house has things you might forget to pack on a vacation that are clutch when you need it (ie beach necessities. ice pack. starter materials like bug spray and sunscreen). Great AC and fans available at the house. Parking available at the house and on the street. Clean bbq grill on the patio. Hosts are attentive and immediately text back. as well as open to giving recommendations as needed. We will be back! Thank you for everything! ‚ù§Ô∏èüåäüáµüá∑

I would definitely recommend Manuel and Rebecca‚Äôs services.

17666821,Michael,January,2019,Amazing Hosts! They provided a great check-in experience and showed us where everything was that we would need. They provided many things that we could not fly with (beach chairs. towels. coolers. etc.). During our trip. we ran out of propane for the grill. we were provided with a new full tank within the hour!  The house was very clean and we were even provided with a ride to the grocery store! Overall a great experience!
17666821,Caroline,January,2019,Rebecca and Manuel have a beautiful place with many thoughtful amenities and perks. Best beach is steps from the house with many other options nearby too.

17666821,Anna,December,2018,Best Airbnb we have ever stayed at.

Amazing experience. don‚Äôt even question if this is the right Airbnb. it is!! Amazing hosts. incredible location. perfect space to relax and enjoy the west coast of PR.
17666821,Alexandra,December,2018,Rebecca and Manuel were amazing hosts and were so incredibly nice! They provided information on the area and were very accommodating.

17666821,Gregory,November,2018,Rebecca and Manuel's house was perfect for our stay at Rincon.  Our only regret is that we weren't staying longer. The cottage is within walking distance of a quiet beautiful beach. restaurants. and shopping. Highly recommend. can't wait to return.  Oh... and they made a giant pot of chicken/vegetable stew waiting for us when we arrived.  Loved it.

There are some board games. etc that were a big hit with our 16 & 10 year old. Great family time. Host gave us lots of tips on where to go & things to do.  Wonder Spring break! Will definitely stay here again hopefully sometime in the near future.

17666821,Amelia,February,2018,Our weekend in Rinc√≥n was made extra special by our stay at Rebecca and Manual‚Äôs. They were all around exceptionally wonderful hosts. Their prompt responses to our questions and warm and helpful guidance with regards to restaurant recommendations and things to do around town really made the whole experience enjoyable. Manuel even helped my husband find a great auto body shop nearby so he could fix our car. Next time we come to Rinc√≥n we will definitely be staying at their house!

17666821,Kim,February,2018,Our hosts were amazing and the location was perfect!  Would definitely recommend this place to everyone!
17666821,Josselyne,February,2018,We (2 of us) had booked this beautiful space many months ago. long before Maria sit the island. and despite all of the issues created for the island for the months that followed. Rebecca and Manuel were in touch and kept us updated as the Island. town. and community recovered. When we heard that electricity had returned and Rincon was ready for visitors. we didn't think twice about continuing with our plans. After a stay at another location had to be canceled (due to the storm). our hosts made it easy to book the added days with them. and they made sure AirBnB adjusted our fees so that we had one long stay. instead of a couple patched together. I appreciated that thoughtfulness SO much! And that was before we even arrived. And that welcome felt completely sincere and present the entire duration of our stay. which was almost a month. You won't find better hosts than Rebecca and Manuel. and we both felt like a big part of the quality of our stay was due to their wonderful hospitality. Because our arrival was on a major holiday (3 Kings Day) most places were closed by the time we landed - but they made sure we had some basics in the fridge. knowing there were few options for shopping that day. and that made our settling in MUCH easier. We didn't have too many times where we had questions or concerns. but the one or two times we did have questions. they were always in communication and on top of it. It is a short distance from Aquadilla (BQN) to the house. and we easily found it. It's in a very safe and friendly neighborhood. and while not the place to go if you want to feel solitude from others (it's a real community neighborhood. not a resort area). it's the *perfect* place to stay if what you're looking for is a welcoming. authentic and friendly home base. The property is a townhouse-style home; there is a driveway for the car. but we often as not parked on the street in front. On the 1st floor is a comfortable living room with TV/DVD player/Cable. and an internet modem (worked great.) There is ample space to store things in closets. and we had lots of room to keep our scuba and other gear. The kitchen had basically everything we needed and we ate in-house as often as not. which is saying something in a town full of amazing restaurants! A lovely dining room gave us ample space to eat. play board or card games. and there was a nice small work desk/area with room for a laptop. etc. for when we wanted to get some work done. (Which was not often.) There is a laundry room and that area has a small shower (helps to keep from tracking sand in the house. which helped us to be more mindful guests) as well as a utility sink and cleaning items like a...Show more
17666821,Linda,December,2017,"I travelled with my husband. two children (soon 4 and 7 years old). and my mother. We had a wonderful stay at Rebecca¬¥s and Manuel¬¥s. The house is just a few minutes walk from the public beach. and we warmly recommend to bring some picnic and/or beer to the beach and watch the sunset. Sun chairs and a freezer bag. and even beach toys for the children were provided in the house.Beds were comfortable with AC in all three bedrooms. The kitchen had everything we needed. including toaster. coffeemaker. blender and mixer. We loved the pretty patio with a big barbecue grill (gas) and enjoyed our dinners under the stars.Rebecca and Manuel were very friendly and helpful and even brought some Christmas gifts for our daughters. My husband likes to snorkel and Manuel lend him some gear when he heard that.Some things we enjoyed in the area during our stay:- Thursday night art walk/fair at the plaza (4-10 pm). A lot of light decorations and pretty handcrafted things to look at.- Morning yoga in the shadow with an ocean view at Barefoot yoga. Every day at 9 am. A very welcoming atmosphere. and all levels of yogis welcome! www.barefootyogapr.com- Fish tacos at Beach House Rincon. just a short few minutes drive from the house along road 413.- The public beach is really nice!- Crashboat Beach. is 35 minutes drive. but sooo worth it! Crystal clear water and white sand. And 5 pm ""the Pelican man"" comes and feeds the pelicans. We totally recommend this place and would love to come back!Show more"
17666821,Response from Rebecca And Manuel,September,2017,Thank you Corey! We feel very glad that you had a good stay. Many blessings. See you later!
17666821,Leslie,August,2017,We were immediately won over by the hosts.  They are warm. welcoming and simply wonderful.  In fact. Rebecca greeted us with a delicious home cooked meal.  The villa is very comfortable and has all the amenities you need to feel at home.  Even shampoo. conditioner. laundry soap and some food staples!!!  It is close to everything and within walking distance to Marina beach. restaurants. convenience store and downtown plaza.  Although a car is needed to be able to visit places outside of Rincon.  It's a safe neighborhood.  Very quiet.  The owners were just a call or text away and very accommodating.  I highly recommend staying here.  In fact. my next visit to Rincon. I will book here again.
17666821,Raelyn,August,2017,This house in Rincon was amazing.  The location and access to everything was perfect for our family with 2 young kids.  We enjoyed walking to the beach. to town. and restaurants.  The neighborhood is perfectly quiet and gives you a sense of being home.Rebecca and Manuel were wonderful and greeted us when we arrived and were attentive when we had questions about Rincon or the house.  our children loved the house from the private patio to the coloring books and games to the nice easy walk to the beach. Although. this place is a townhouse and shares walls we did not hear the neighbors when were inside.  This is a lovely place and we highly recommend staying here when you are visiting Rincon.

17666821,Kelsey,July,2017,We had a wonderful stay in Rebecca and Manuel's home. They had everything we needed for a fun and comfortable vacation. The location was central to nightlife. restaurants. shops. and a short walk to the beach. Rebecca and Manuel were quick to respond to any questions. and helped us to have a great stay. Plus. the air conditioning was a huge advantage. We would absolutely stay here again!
17666821,Lindsay,July,2017,Our family of eight stayed here for 3 days and we all loved the space and location of the home. There was just enough room for all of us. and the half bath and extra shower were a great help when all of us returned from the beach. The kitchen is fully equipped with a lot of pots and pans which we used to make breakfast. We cooked on the outside grill and ate dinner on the private patio at night. Rebecca and Manuel were there when we arrived and showed us around and kindly provided us a big pineapple which we used to make Pina Coladas. There are Beach chairs. beach towels. and a carrying cooler to use. which was a huge plus for our beach day. We enjoyed our stay very much and hope to all return for a longer stay in the future.
17666821,Kimberly,June,2017,Everything at this house was amazing! Rebecca & Manuel were lovely hosts and were always available. They were also very flexible.

17666821,Rachael,April,2017,Great location.  Easy communication with Manuel & Rebecca.  We really enjoyed this townhouse.  Perfect for a group looking to relax and explore Rincon.  Board games were a major plus!  Just be sure to get directions to the place from the host as the AirBNB directions link in the app to maps were incorrect (probably an AirBNB technical issue).
17666821,Joe,April,2017,This house was in the perfect location to the beach and the local dive shop. restaurant and bars! Just a few minute drive to the town center and no matter where you go everyone is very friendly! We will definitely be visiting again!

2008603,Emili,June,2022,We had the best time here! The location is incredible- directly in the middle of rinc√≥n with a close drive to anywhere. 2 minute drive from Tres Palmas beach. next to a great brunch spot as well. We adored this house and never wanted to leave! The porch and out door shower really made this place top notch.
2008603,David,June,2022,Great location. it is in a very remote location. so it may take just alittle longer to find. But once you do. it‚Äôs very private. Great stay.
2008603,Response from Tim,July,2022,I responded to Marta within 5 min each time. I charged Marta $40/night. If you are looking for an urban setting this is not the place for you.
2008603,Response from Tim,June,2022,Disappointed in Matt‚Äôs review. I responded within 2 hours to all of his messages.  I take pride in my communication skills and I‚Äôm far from being a corporation. Matt‚Äôs failure to check out on time and me having to communicate that to him is likely the reason for his negative comment. I however chose to take the high road and didn‚Äôt review Matt negatively. Rest assured this a 5 star accommodation for ridiculously cheap rates. Location Location Location.Show more
2008603,Thomas,December,2021,Overall our stay was great. The place is very clean and what you see is what you get. Tim was a great host. Be aware that there is a resident living above the unit. This caused no issues for us. Also be aware that this is not the easiest place to get to. Four wheel drive recommended. Host does a great job clearly outlining how to access the place (read carefully). Wi-Fi was pretty spotty.I would recommend this place for any surfers or visitors looking to get a great Rincon local experience.
2008603,Hwang,July,2021,This place was pretty great. It has a nice patio area and provided what we needed. The road to get there the very first time was a little rocky as we were coming in very late at night and didn‚Äôt really know the area. Quickly got the hang of it during the day though and it‚Äôs a tranquil drive. Location was closed to a lot of things in the area (English Rose. Lighthouse. etc)  and the property had delicious fruit that we got to enjoy!
2008603,Lisa,July,2021,Tim is an amazing. communicative host. The views from this place are spectacular-literally. once-in-a lifetime-vistas! To be clear. the location is VERY remote. so if you are looking for peace and quiet. this is definitely your place. Just make sure you have some sort of reliable transportation during your stay. and then you will be able to appreciate your proximity to the heavens each night when you return.
2008603,Rebekah,July,2021,This place is really good for the price.   Super clean. nice view (although the trees are much taller than in the photos). perfect location.   It‚Äôs right across the street from Steps beach. a must if you are interested in snorkeling.    Also. take note there are banana. star fruit. mango and avocado trees on the property!   So cool!
2008603,Marlene,July,2021,Good place to stay. nice view.
2008603,Peter,July,2021,Perfect. the whole family loved being in nature.
2008603,David,June,2021,Great value. clean. and great views! Close to everything in Rincon. Great spot.
2008603,James,June,2021,If you are looking for an economically priced Airbnb in Rincon. this is it. The location is pretty much as good as it gets. with an amazing view and close proximity to nearly everything in Rincon. The house actually sits right next to probably the best breakfast spot in Rincon. the English Rose. Steps Beach is the closest beach. and has amazing snorkeling.
2008603,Nika,June,2021,We had an absolutely spectacular stay! I had to work 4/7 days I stayed there with my friends but I didn't even regret it because of the remarkable views from the terrace. The bed was also very comfortable! We all loved the outdoor shower! The 5 minute drive down to the beach was awesome. 1 warning: follow the directions you're sent once you book your stay to the T.  Google will try actively to kill you on the journey up the hill.Also if you've ever wanted to pick fresh mangoes. avocado. starfruit. bananas. coconuts. and tamarind. this is the place to be!We can't wait to come back!!!
2008603,Alex,June,2021,Very comfortable beds. the outdoor shower is such an awesome experience. be ready for a large. steep hill to get to the house.
2008603,Klaus,May,2021,we couldn't have asked for more. quick drive to amazing surf beaches and really nice patio with a great view to hangout on.
2008603,Martin,May,2021,Good and spacious place. Tim was very responsive and willing to help. Unfortunately. the internet did not work so we had to accommodate using mobile hotspot which was also not very strong given the location.
2008603,Nancy,April,2021,We had a great stay! The location up the hill. across from Steps beach. with a very nice coffee shop close by made it a great stay. Thanks Tim!
2008603,Amanda,March,2021,Great place to stay in rincon! Super close to everything‚Äî the beaches. shops. towns. restaurants. bars.  All a 5 min drive or 35 min walk.  Hills are steep for sure but once you get used to them they aren‚Äôt bad.
2008603,Maxwell,March,2021,Perhaps the best view in Rincon. Quiet. peaceful. and with everything you need for a comfortable stay (incl. plenty of kitchen gear). Tim and family were amazing hosts. wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay here again.
2008603,Reuben,February,2021,Nice Place. bathroom is very tiny but it‚Äôs an awesome place overall. Tim was a good host and sorted out an AC problem in the same day that it was reported. Two thumbs up on that one for sure.
2008603,Andrew,February,2021,This place has AMAZING views. If your looking for a nice place to wake up and clear your head. this is it. The directions to the place are a bit overwhelming at first but just locate the English Rose next door and you will be just fine. Will probably be back !
2008603,Casey,February,2021,Great deck with amazing ocean views. an outdoor shower. and all the basics.  Up in the hills away from town so it's nice and quiet.
2008603,Jake,January,2021,I have stayed with Tim before. maybe 8 or 10 years ago. well before Airbnb.  Great as always.  House in a amazing location of Rincon.  So quiet on the top of the hill with amazing views and a nice breeze. You can‚Äôt find a better place to stay in rincon. especially for the price.
2008603,Arthur,January,2021,Thanks for having us! Cool spot.
2008603,Megan,March,2020,Tim‚Äôs place was an absolute dream at the top of Puerto Rico. Spectacular views of the ocean and the lush green landscape of Rincon. Not to mention a delicious cafe just down the street and only minutes from town. His place is clean and spacious. I would love to return for another stay!
2008603,Christine,March,2020,Tim's place is centrally located in Rincon with an ocean view. We stayed on the main part of the house which was clean and had everything from beach towels to all the kitchen gadgets you could need on your vacation. We spent most of our time on the spacious deck which overlooked a tropical forest with the sounds of birds. roosters and the coqui frogs! Thank you Tim for sharing your home with us.  it made for a great relaxing vacation for my husband and me!
2008603,Brendan,February,2020,The apartment and the whole property were amazing. Loved having a giant balcony to lounge and eat meals on. surrounded by clear ocean views. steeply rolling hills and lush tropical foliage/forest.  Cool and breezy at night. Steep drive up  but easy to find. A great location and only a quick drive to everything in Rincon. Would be happy as a clam to move here.
2008603,Angelica,February,2020,I enjoyed the home. it had its own personality. unlike a hotel. The view was amazing. the ocean. the trees. the drive was not bad at all. just 10 minutes to Sandy Beach. I surely recommend it. if you want a relaxing stay.
2008603,Jessica,January,2020,The views were AMAZING! We had a lovely stay. There are window units in both bedrooms so sleeping was very comfortable. It‚Äôs a bit off the beaten path but super worth it for the views and the privacy. Highly recommend.
2008603,Jessica,January,2020,Beautiful and quiet!  We will be back
2008603,Charles,September,2019,Loved the proximity to Rincon without the hustle and bustle (not that there was a lot of that) in the off-season. Should have planned for 2-3 weeks instead of just one. Looking forward to a return.
2008603,Bob,August,2019,Really enjoyed this comfy place at the top of the hill above Steps Beach. Sitting in the hammock chair outside and watching the sun set as the Coqui frogs gradually get louder into the night is an experience that just couldn't be better. The apartment was clean and had everything needed to make great breakfasts. I'd certainly stay there again. Thanks Tim!
2008603,Tracie,August,2019,Beautiful home up in the hills. We were in middle of three levels. It‚Äôs quite large and has plenty of room to stretch out. The covered veranda was an added bonus. Beds were comfortable with nice. high quality linens and there were plenty of bath and beach towels. The road up to the house is quite steep but it‚Äôs well worth the stay. Takes about 2 minutes to drive down to Steps Beach or Tres Palmas and there is a lovely little breakfast restaurant within walking distance of the house.  Make sure to park away from the almond trees. Trust me!
2008603,Jesse,July,2019,Me and the family greatly enjoyed our stay at Tim‚Äôs  place. You felt like you were away from town without being too far. It was a great experience !! We highly recommend it! It had everything we needed. A home away from home!!
2008603,Michael,July,2019,Tim was very responsive. Communication definitely deserves 10 stars. Overall the stay was amazing. Tim also let us check in earlier than check in time and also allowed us to check out later. Will be staying there next time I come into the island. Thank you Tim.
2008603,Michelle,July,2019,Awesome views . the English Rose is literally close . and is very close to steps beach .
2008603,Paola,April,2019,Tim is amazing always answered my calls and any question I had. The place is amazing. The view is spectacular!
2008603,Jacob,March,2019,Wow what a great host.  Tim provided us with not only an amazing home away from home but didn‚Äôt skip a beat on the amenities.  Full kitchen to cook. indoor and outdoor shower. beach gear. ac. etc.  Easy check-in and out. let us extend our stay. and the house is minutes from the beach.  View is absolutely breathtaking.  A++
2008603,Nick,March,2019,Fantastic apartment with great views and any amenity you'd need for your stay.
2008603,Ninna,March,2019,This place was amazing! My friends and I stayed there for spring break and it was perfect! The only down side is that you are not right on the beach and walking to the beach is not really an option because of the steep hills and long hike one would embark. But still in a great location. close to local bars and steps beach. A bunch of towels were also provided which was a huge plus! Overall amazing place! And amazing views!
2008603,Colleen,March,2019,Tim‚Äôs place was amazing! It was quiet and very clean.  It has awesome views of the water and was in the perfect location. It is close to the beach (defiantly recommend a car. very steep hill) but also provides privacy. We would totally recommend Tim‚Äôs place for your next visit to Rincon. Can't wait to go back.
2008603,Jesse,March,2019,This spot is great for its views and is a good location for anyone that wants to be less than 10 min from most of what you need in Rincon. This house is on top of the hill straight up from steps beach. Beautiful sunsets every night and we were able to wake up and be surfing at Maria‚Äôs in 15 min or less. The kitchen had everything we needed and having beach towels included was definitely a plus. This is a great spot for the price.
2008603,Enrique,February,2019,Amazing views!
2008603,Kelsey,February,2019,This place is amazing! It is set back from the bustle of town but its a short drive into Rincon if you do need to get anything. It truly does have endless ocean views and is a short drive to a bunch of awesome surf spots/beautiful beaches. We will hopefully be back in the future!
2008603,Stefanie,February,2019,This place has the most beautiful views. clean and kitchen was fully stocked. There was air conditioners in both rooms which made sleeping wonderful. A washer and dryer if you needed it. A outside shower which my son used a  couple of times and thought was the most amazing thing. They also had many towels for bath and to go the beach. Its was wonderful!!!
2008603,Theresa,January,2019,The place is basic but has all the things you need to get started. Being in the hills made for an interesting first night driving in but was a definite plus because it was a peaceful retreat from the tourist hustle and bustle. The view is worth it alone! Our favorite part of our trip was our morning breakfasts on the patio.We also had some bug issues (no see ums and ants) but it is PR and with all the windows open by a lot of foliage I guess it‚Äôs to be expected. I would say for the location and price it‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs not the most plush but has everything you need for a great time in Rinc√≥n.
2008603,Diana,January,2019,The place was beautiful! There are many great place to eat near the house! It was very relaxing. and the group enjoyed their stay :)
2008603,Dan,June,2018,Absolutely beautiful place in the hills of Rincon. The location is perfect and as peaceful as can be. Comfortable furnishings and well equipped kitchen make this a lovely place to call home during your trip to Rincon.
2008603,Thomas,March,2016,We had a great long weekend! Beautiful view and a great space. Close to everything. especially The English Rose. I highly recommend it!
2008603,Shannon,February,2016,I would like to tell you that you should not rent this apartment. and that you should stay away.  But I would only be doing that so that I can have it all to myself.  Endless Ocean Views Retreat was an incredible place to stay. and made our trip to Rincon even more amazing.  It IS an incredibly steep climb to get to it. but even this has the advantage of offering peace and quite.  And the ride back to 413 is less than a mile. minutes to Maria's beach or the marina.  The apartment is well stocked with everything you could need to be comfortable. and the huge deck is a relaxing place to spend the morning or evening watching nature.  The host. Kimberly. was very friendly and responsive.  It was a great experience for us. and I could not recommend it more highly.
2008603,David,January,2016,Kim's home is bright. clean and quiet with a welcoming breeze located on top of a hill overlooking the Caribbean. Our family of 5 found it very comfortable after long days on the beach and in the water. The walk down to steps beach is easy compared to the walk back. A car is definitely a must. We would love  to return.
2008603,Wesley,July,2015,Great location. nice view. surrounded by fruit trees. The apt was nice. clean and spacious. Plenty of towels and looked like lots of beach gear if you need it. Everything was easy. We enjoyed our stay. Do note. this is one of 4 or 5 apartments on the property. so you may meet other vacationers. That can be good or not what you are looking for. While we were there. we were the only ones and it was total peace. Nice place!
2008603,Natalia,June,2015,Endless Ocean Views is a nice apartment in a first floor of a two story house. It is at the shade of a mango tree on top of a steep street  that connects route 413 with 115. Despite of being relatively close to the beach. one must consider the 7 min drive up a hill. This makes it nice and quiet. but you really need a car to get around. We were the only ones staying at the premisses. so we were privilege with a lot of privacy. The beds are very confortable. One of the rooms has a sliding door to access the balcony. and you can see the ocean view from the bed. The other room has a twin bed beside the double bed. perfect for a family room. Everything very clean and well organised. Fully equipped (kitchen utensils. pots. oil. salt. detergent... towels. toilet paper. even shampoo and toothpaste in case you forget). Cable TV perfect service. A/C working good. but no Internet connection was possible at any time. Outside shower was great! (also with hot water). We had a great time! Thanks. Kimberly!
2008603,Daniella,June,2015,The place was great. set up was good. It had all we needed to be comfortable. We drove to the beach everyday. it was a step drive but it was small so pretty convenient. I texted Kimberly a couple times and always got a quick response. which was really nice. The English rose far exceeded our expectations. Thank you Kimberly for a wonderful stay.
2008603,Samuel,May,2015,Our stay was excellent. the property was very clean and have whatever you may need. including surfboards. The location is at the top of the mountain and at the same time very close to the beach. Very clean and great views.I will return very soon.
2008603,Ad,April,2015,OK. I had to resend my questions because I did not get answer but OK.
2008603,Dennis,March,2015,Kim was very nice and accommodating.  The house is very orderly and comfortable.  Nice and quiet and relaxing and just a short hop from everything.  I would definitely stay here again.
2008603,Philipp,November,2014,Great spot with a beautiful view. The place was nice and clean and had towels and beach towels. The communication with the owner was excellent. I would recommend this place to a friend.
2008603,Sarah,December,2013,Kim and Tim were super nice! My bf and I had a great time at the house. Beautiful views and tucked away on a hill. close to the English rose- yummy breakfast spot. Overall the house was comfortable but really basic and not worth $250 a night for 3 people. The kitchen was not stocked well. only salt. If you are planning to eat out most of the time. this apt is not for you.
2008603,Charlotte,December,2018,Tim's place is located in a very quiet area with a great view of the sea and greenery. The rooms are spacious but without shutters or curtains so awake very early.The apartment/ house is quite clean despite the fact that the 4 of us were bitten by species of fleas. very unpleasant. Strong itchiness across the whole body in contact with the home fabrics (sheets. chairs. sofa) We're sorry we didn't have any contact with the host. no truly non-existing greeting. Despite our calls and texts as we had a lot of trouble finding the place. Very disappointed overall. lack of outdoor maintenance and no hospitality. no interaction.Translated from French¬†¬†Show original
20637671,Alyshah,June,2022,We loved staying with Michelle! So much so. we're now in her other AirBnB unit. Michelle was attentive and shared ideas of fun things for us to do in Rincon and around the coast. She was thoughtful and covered so many lovely touches that made staying with her enjoyable - from the beach towels. to toiletries. and the plethora of space. While we were with her. we needed a new sink drain - and she quickly grabbed us 5 different options from the store. She's been so kind and welcoming. would definitely suggest staying at her property! A big plus is the spacious balcony with couches and a hammock - it has a lovely water view.
20637671,Emily,June,2022,Great location. the space is great for anyone looking to explore the area. many beaches near by. Michelle was very kind and accommodating!
20637671,Donald,November,2019,One of the better places to stay in Rincon.
20637671,Zac,June,2019,You can expect your own condo with a back porch with a water view. Beaches are at the bottom of the hill and it‚Äôs not far from downtown Rincon. Super laid back and peaceful.
20637671,Stephanie,April,2019,Michelle's place is perfect! The pictures don't do it justice. It's a very spacious one-bedroom apartment with a full kitchen and dining area. living room / sitting area. and large bedroom. There's a cute garden out front. It's in a great location - close to everything but in a quiet spot. What makes it so special is Michelle - she's an amazing host and really cool person. I'll definitely be back!
20637671,Kahra,March,2019,413 Getaway was perfect! Great location. easy to find. and never a problem finding parking - we used the side street for parking which was very easy. Michelle offered daily suggestions for things to do and places to visit to make sure that we got the most out of our trip. She was very easy to communicate with and offered prompt responses. Fantastic hospitality. and an adorable. spacious home. Overall. this was a wonderful experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.
20637671,Carolyn,March,2019,My fianc√© and I overall had a good stay at Michelle‚Äôs. The location was great. very close to the best surfing beaches and the apartment was clean and nicely furnished. Michelle was very friendly and gave us some recommendations of fun things to do. We did run into a few issues with water and power - most of which were beyond Michelle‚Äôs control since the entire area of Puntas is currently undergoing water rationing and occasional power outages. We also had problems with our shower not having hot water. and then the water reserve ran out - but Michelle was very responsive and had the issues resolved as quickly as possible. Also. the address on Airbnb is incorrect. so ask Michelle for the correct address beforehand.
20637671,Michael,February,2019,Awesome stay on the heart of the 413! Awesome apartment with easy access to all of Rincon and surrounding areas. Michelle is also happy to help with recommendations and tips throughout your stay. Have fun and pray for surf!
20637671,Mackenzie,February,2019,Nice accommodations. Michelle is so nice and friendly. all around it was a great time.
20637671,Jake,November,2018,Michelle's spot is great and super close to local surf destinations. Although other comments say that the address is wrong. it is quite easy to find as it is literally right across from KM Marker 3.6. Would highly recommend anyone in town stay here.
20637671,Trey,November,2018,Have no worries about staying here. Convenient . clean and Michelle is great. Highly recommend !
20637671,Getulio,September,2018,Michelle‚Äôs place is wonderfully located in Rincon. it has a Beautiful view from the balcony and the apt is very modern and decorated with style. Highly recommended for anyone looking to escape!
20637671,Cristian,August,2018,Great relaxing place. very close to the beaches in Rincon. We drove and got there very fast but it should be possible to walk as well. The place was clean and had good furniture and appliances for 2 people.
20637671,Lucero,July,2018,Lovely space. great communication with host. location its not accurate but everything else is perfect!
20637671,Sonya,July,2018,The apt was cute and clean. We had everything we needed. Good location and great value.
20637671,Christian,June,2018,Vey peaceful place. Accurate description and Michelle were very nice with us.
20637671,Bernadette,June,2018,Excellent location and lovely spot. As mentioned by others. AirBnB location is wrong but Michelle was available to guide us. The apartment is located close to all Rinc√≥n Road 413 restaurants. shops and amazing beaches. You definitely should consider this bnb as your next getaway!
20637671,Jerone,June,2018,A wonderful home that offers plenty of privacy and space. all within walking distance of Rincon's famous beaches. the lighthouse. and great nightlife.  If you want to feel like you're living the Puerto Rican beachtown life like a local (i.e. not in some hotel or lodge). then you should let Michelle be your host!
20637671,Antonio,May,2018,Amazing host and a very beautiful place. Rinc√≥n is awesome and Michelle made it better!
20637671,Ben,April,2018,Great place located close to everything in Rincon. Would definitely stay there again!
20637671,Gustavo,April,2018,Nice and clean apartment.  Close to Maria's beach. Michelle was a super cool host. the communication was superb and she even surprised us telling us that we could check out late.
20637671,Nate,March,2018,We really appreciated Michelle's local tips. and even got a daily report about the best spots to surf!
20637671,Matthew,March,2018,Great space. A small drive to Rincon but great location with AC. Dont go by maps in airbnb!!!! Talk with host to get accurate directions. They dont have addresses here. Its all by kilometer marker so.....if its 3.6 km route 413.....you are staying near thr 3.6km marker. That is huge to find the place in the dark
20637671,Emily,March,2018,The house was super convenient - close to Sandy Beach and Marias Beach. It was quiet and peaceful and I was able to cook almost all my meals at the house.  Michelle was very helpful. thoughtful and kind! All in all I had a great experience and amazing trip :) The address given on AirBnB was incorrect. so verify with Michelle before arriving :)
20637671,Nicholas,March,2018,Place was dope. Relaxing. perfect location. great view. couldn‚Äôt ask for more. Michelle is super cool and helpful. She knows what‚Äôs going on in town too. ask her for recommendations.
20637671,Elizabeth,February,2018,Michelle was very hospitable and flexible with our early check-in time. She was easy to communicate with and offered us some excellent recommendations for restaurants. places to explore and things to do. The place was as advertised. we liked how convenient it was to get into town and the proximity to the beach. Loved the hammock on the back porch. Thanks Michelle!
20637671,Andrew,January,2018,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
20637671,Carlos & Tunde,September,2017,Responsive. place was clean and as advertised. Has a nice view from the balcony. Quiet area good for resting. Great location near el faro de Rincon and many other places. Start at Michelle's while visiting Rincon.
20637671,Gabriel,April,2018,Good spot. close to everything. great hostess.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

48192770,Beatrice,September,2022,Nice home . nice location
48192770,Vanessa,August,2022,"This house is an absolute gem in a magical location. You can walk to just about anything that Rincon has to offer. It is ""Steps"" away from one of the best beaches in Rincon for snorkeling. It is peaceful and serene:) We hope to be back one day!"
48192770,Dennis,July,2022,The location of this house is perfect. A short walk to a magical. quiet beach and marina. and a short drive to all Rincon has to offer. My family loved the rooftop pool. and the well-equipped kitchen allowed us to eat in just as comfortably as we dined out. The hosts were responsive and helpful. Highly recommend this stay.
48192770,Laura,July,2022,Amazing week we spent at Casa Vela . Julia great host and very helpful we have you in our number one for our next visit to PR ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è
48192770,Michelle,June,2022,We had a wonderful stay at Casa Vela.  It was clean. comfortable and spacious!  Everything you could possibly need was in the house. With six of us. there was ample space to spread out.  We loved the pool and roof top view.  The girls worked out every morning in the upstairs exercise area.  Steps beach was an easy walk for snorkeling.  The marina was a quick walk for a nice beach to spend an afternoon. We were able to rent snorkel gear. paddle boards and kayaks there as well.  We took a day trip to Aguadilla for an excursion on the water and drove to San Sebastian to see the falls.  These were all within an hour of the house.  This was our 7th year to come to Puerto Rico and 6th time to Rincon.  Casa Vela is by far our favorite place to stay!
48192770,Esther,June,2022,Just a wonderful location and hostess was very accommodating to anything you may  need help with.
48192770,Susan,May,2022,The  place was very clean and updated with all the essentials you need. The pool on the top level was refreshing after a day at the beach. We would definitely return. Thanks you Julia.

48192770,Scott,May,2022,Great house. location. and communication from Julia.  Highly recommended!
48192770,Tom & Julie,December,2021,A little bit of heaven. This is a special Airbnb. Great location. The house is situated next to a large field and proves to be a great place to start off and then to return to after a day at one of the many nearby beaches.  It‚Äôs spare in a good way. a clean slate ready for you to kick back and enjoy your Rincon adventures with your fellow travelers. There‚Äôs a lovely and spacious outdoor veranda with a sectional couch. a hammock and dining table. Just above on the next floor is another outdoor area with a rooftop. saltwater pool. Indoors there‚Äôs a large common living area and well-equipped kitchen. In all. what we love about this Airbnb is that it‚Äôs super comfortable and clean. The bedrooms are large and the beds are comfortable. We‚Äôd come back in a heartbeat. Julia is a conscientious host who readily offers great suggestions.
48192770,Michelle,December,2021,We would highly recommend Julia‚Äôs place. The whole house was well organized.
48192770,Vicki,December,2021,Our stay at Julia‚Äôs home was incredible!! I can‚Äôt recommend staying here enough. The house was so clean. and it‚Äôs huge! So many different bedrooms and bathrooms to choose from. Having a well stocked laundry room and towels available was awesome. The kitchen was well stocked also. There are coolers. towels. and 4 beach chairs you can bring to one of the close by beaches. Lots of restaurants within walking distance. and town is less than a 5 minute drive where there are so many restaurants to choose from. The roof top pool was amazing with stunning views of the sunset every night. I travel a lot. and this was one of the best airbnbs I‚Äôve ever stayed in. Thank you. Julia!!
48192770,Arelis,October,2021,Julia‚Äôs Casa Vela was everything we expected. she was so communicative and the home is so spacious and clean. the view from the pool area is breathtaking! and if you drive just four mins you‚Äôll find some very good local spots. Definitely will return!
48192770,Kate,September,2021,This is a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood and walking distance to the beach where you‚Äòll find great snorkeling right from shore. The roof top pool was awesome! Julia very responsive and helped us with the issues we had. Kitchen very well stocked. plenty of towels. There were no hand towels or wash cloths so maybe bring a couple. Small problem in this magnificent space. Great also to have a washer/dryer. Would Definitely return!!
48192770,Philip,September,2021,Case Vela was absolutely perfect for our week in Puerto Rico. More than enough space for our group. and you really can't beat the view from the pool on the roof.The kitchen was very comfortable and well-provisioned: had no trouble cooking or making drinks. and the covered deck with lounge and hammock on that floor was great in the morning and evenings when we weren't at the beach.We were also pleasantly surprised with the more personal touches. namely beach chairs and cooler bag at our disposal.Julia was a great host and responsive throughout the week. you should stay here!
48192770,Ivy,February,2021,Well. what an epic trip to Casa Vela! From the start. communication was easy and quick with Julia. She had advice on all the local stuff and even traffic! Then we arrived to a spotless house with a caring note! It‚Äôs just a walk from the beach and easy to get to surfing. The sheets are SO soft and the beds SO comfy. It‚Äôs really a large place and we stayed in during the hottest hours of the day and there was ample space to lounge. The pool on the roof is the real awesomeness. Sunsets? Yes please! We didn‚Äôt want to leave and are already planning out next trip back. So epic! Rinc√≥n is a great place and we‚Äôve been before but Casa Vela really made this trip what it was. We‚Äôll be back!!
48192770,Grace,February,2021,Casa Vela exceeded our expectations! The location is ideal. the house is clean. spacious & beautifully designed. and the recommendations from Julia were so helpful. We could easily walk to the beach or the marina and loved spending time by the rooftop pool. Perfect home for a relaxing vacation. Julia is a fantastic host and we‚Äôll definitely be back!
40617210,Chris,December,2022,Nice spot. Clean. Easy parking. Pool is great. The building is close to the road so there is occasional road noise which interrupts the otherwise serene setting to the property. I would stay there are but in a unit that faced the yard rather than road.
40617210,Alicia,December,2022,Amazing stay!!! Raul was super attentive and helpful. The place was sparkling clean and well kept landscape/pool. This was beyond peaceful and more than I could have imagined. Convenient location to restaurants. activities. and highways. Highly recommend!

40617210,Cilia,February,2020,It as a real pleasure staying in one of Raul‚Äôs apartments.We were staying in apartment number 3. which shares an outdoor living room with I believe two more apartments. I loved sitting there reading and listening to the birds and other outdoor sounds.The apartment and outdoor areas too. were sparkling clean. The pool and around it with barbecue and several other sitting areas a great place to hang out and meet other guests. Raul got back to us always within half an hour. He was easy to work with and very accommodating.We will come back!

636853841910789987,Sthafany,July,2022,This Airbnb was beautiful and very worthy the value. The home decor and theme was amazing and very creative! It was definitely a jungle Airbnb. surrounded with nature and coqui. All the small details were great. The area was amazing and there were many good restaurants. I would definitely book this Airbnb again if I‚Äôm in the area of Rincon. PR again!
636853841910789987,Blaise,July,2022,The Jungle lives up to its name with full immersion amongst the trees. the apartment is beautifully decorated and conveniently located. I would definitely stay again!
636853841910789987,Chelsea,July,2022,We loved staying at this apartment! The decor was amazing and so artistic.

One of the best properties we have ever stayed with AirBnB!    Most highly recommended for next stay in Rincon!
636853841910789987,Sarah,June,2022,"There are not enough words to describe how wonderful of a stay this was for us. We had 4 guests. 2 couples. and our service animal. We WILL be back. Luckily we're only 3 hours away!!!!-Check in super easy - we arrived 3 hours later than expected because we stopped at the outlets to shop. Luckily this was not an issue!-5 minute walk to Casa Isle√±a and beaches. -Beds are extremely comfortable. AC cold (essential in PR especially after a long day at the beach). tons of food options within walking/driving distance-Kitchen has everything you could possibly need to create meals in the comfort of your own home-The view is spectacular. During our stay it was raining so we were able to enjoy coffee on the balcony which was incredible. -Bring bug spray because you are in ""The Jungle""-Pool was warm. clean and spacious-Hot shower/perfect amenities (towels were soooo soft and luxurious) -There are little kitties that roam the property (if you are new to PR don't be alarmed. we bought some cans of food to feed the hungry and I suggest you do too. if you have a heart :) )TLDR: Wonderful. tropical experience in the jungle with everything you could possibly need to be comfortable away from home. Will be staying here anytime we are in Rincon! Thank you Allison. you are AWESOME <3 See you next time and maybe with baby!!! ;)Show more"
636853841910789987,Rachel,June,2022,Very charming spot on top of the hill. The decor was very cute perfect for a beach stay and everything was very comfortable and well appointed. There is a large pool in a tranquil setting. close to everything but quiet enough at night to hear the sounds of the jungle. Exactly what we were hoping for !
30206616,Timothy,April,2022,The unit was impeccably clean. bright. comfortable. and within easy walking distance of two of Rincon‚Äôs best beaches. two really good restaurants. and everything else you could need for a beach getaway. It‚Äôs an easy drive into the center of town if you have a reason to leave. but you won‚Äôt want to!
30206616,Chris,March,2022,This is a hotel-quality apartment. It's crisp and spotless and has everything you need - towels. beach towels. beach chairs. yoga mats. shampoo. conditioner. and body wash. The beds are comfortable. There's a big tv with Netflix. a kitchenette. and an awesome deck. It's in a great location near Sandy Beach. which is beautiful. You can see the ocean from the deck. The walk to public beach access is short. It equates to a city block or block and a half. On the way. you pass a cute bar/burger joint (Kahunas). a nice beach front restuarant (Tamboo) and a coffee/acai bowl shop (Jake's Java). While a Rincon vacation involves a good bit of driving. if you didn't want to drive all the time. this is great place. We had a really nice stay.
30206616,Erin,February,2022,Great place to stay! Modern but very comfortable and cozy with great light and patio. Hosts are very thoughtful. providing cooler. beach towels & chairs along with a complimentary bag.
30206616,Megan,January,2022,Perfect location. Could walk to the beach/shops/restaurants. Loved all the info that the hosts gave us about the area
30206616,Taheshah,December,2021,My mother and I really enjoyed our stay here. We had big smiles on our faces when we saw a happy birthday sign and balloons in the room as the trip was to celebrate our birthdays. It‚Äôs little things like that that make a big difference.  Having beach chairs. a blanket. towels and a cooler made beach days so much easier. There is a nice beach right by the place but my mother and I decided to drive down to Playa Buye in Cabo Rojo. You can pick up ice for the cooler at the Rogue  Wave convenience store one minute walking distance from The Beach Pad. The Beach Pad has everything you needThere are a few spots to eat in walking distance which is nice. And just a tip as you plan your trip to Rinc√≥n. every Thursday night starting at 6 pm I believe in the Rinc√≥n Plaza there many vendors with handmade art and other items  and live musicians at what‚Äôs called the Rinc√≥n Art walk! Buy your souvenirs there! I had piece of mind taking to the people who made the items rather than something mass produced from China.
30206616,Abimael,July,2021,I would definitely revisit The Beach Pad. We stayed in the Happy Turtle room for our anniversary. It's such a large and open space with an amazing vibe. Worth the price! It's about a five minute walk to the beach. Alan and Eileen were quick to respond to any questions we had and kept constant communication before and during our stay. We're currently planning to stay with a group of friends in the near future.
30206616,Christine,June,2021,Great location.  Beautiful setting.
30206616,Antonio,June,2021,Wonderful and cozy property close to everything; great restaurants and bars. awesome beaches. and plenty of things to do‚Ä¶yet plenty of peace and quiet! The property is minutes away from the Rincon plaza with even more dining alternatives and other things to do. Communication with the host was quick and never lacking!! Definitively looking forward to a return trip!
30206616,Matthew,June,2021,Alan & Eileen's place was so nice. clean and cozy with a beautiful balcony just steps from the beach. Highly recommended!
30206616,Jessica,May,2021,This little place was super cute and clearly recently updated.  We loved it.  It was really close to a beach that was so beautiful and there were not many other people on it.  We also found sea glass on two morning walks!!  The beach was a bit rough for swimming but it was definitely the prettiest beach we saw on our trip.  Our only hiccup was that someone was parked in our spot but I messaged the  owners and they took care of it immediately.
30206616,Christina,May,2021,If you are staying in Rincon. stay here! First timers to Puerto Rico and so happy we made the trip to the west coast and stayed at the Beach Pad. Everything was made easy by the hosts and the space was incredible (love the theme and decorations). The location was also ideal for being right by the beach and close to bars. yoga. restaurants. The guide and list of restaurants/activities provided by the hosts were super helpful which also made planning so much easier. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a great getaway in Rincon!
30206616,Tyler,May,2021,I‚Äôve been coming to Rincon for a long time and this Airbnb is. hands down. the best in the area. The communication was top notch. The room was perfect amenities were thoughtful. We will certainly be coming back. This place is was Airbnb is all about. The Beach Pad is a 5 star stay through and through.
30206616,Patricia,March,2021,We found Eileen‚Äôs loft while looking for a last minute place to stay after our house had power/water issues. Eileen answered very promptly to our message. and greeted us with tremendous hospitality: fixed the room in record time. accommodated our needs of two twin beds rather than the king size modality. sent a friendly reminder about check out terms on time for us to prepare and meet all check out expectations. Loft was geared with bath towels. beach towels. mini Igloo cooler. coffee maker. and fridge. We didn‚Äôt use cutlery. but I did notice there was a full set and everything you may need to eat meals inside. Single parking soot available. assigned by room was an organized way to sort out parking in the premises. We‚Äôd love to return to The Beach Pad for vacation soon!
30206616,Tom,March,2021,Amazing location and unit.  The hosts were so sweet and provided my wife and i a few special treats as it was our wedding anniversary.   We would highly recommend the Beach Pad and the owners.
30206616,Katherine,February,2021,Great location. very useful local guidebook on recommendations for restaurants in the area. Walking location to beach. Easy check-in and parking included. Comfortable. functional space that fulfilled all our needs! Thanks for the great stay!
30206616,Joel,January,2021,Very clean and neat place! Walking distance to restaurant and the beach
30206616,Jacqueline,January,2021,The place is great. Very edgy. Great location. Close to beautiful beaches. bars and restaurants. Rinc√≥n is amazing.
30206616,Response from Alan And Eileen,October,2020,Thank you for your feedback Noris!! All guests have access to the rooftop deck that has a BBQ grill! The loft you stayed in. the Happy Turtle. is the only loft that does not have a counter stove top because it has the smallest kitchen. All other lofts have a counter stove top. Next time. if you would like to cook in your room. we recommend staying in one of our other lofts!Show more
30206616,Tyler,September,2020,An incredible stay! Comes with an iPad that has all of their local recommendations. which are amazing by the way. Located steps from the beach. and local bars I would highly recommend this stay. Even met the owners and they were very lovely. along with their dog Max!
30206616,Edmarie,September,2020,Alan & Eileen‚Äôs place is awesome! The location is amazing. just by Sandy Beach and just minutes to Steps Beach and other beautiful beaches. The room was brand new. extremely clean and great amenities to get you ready for a beach day. In addition to that. Alan & Eileen were great hosts going above and beyond to make our stay an unforgettable experience.Recommend this 100%!!
30206616,Lorena,August,2020,Great stay! Spotless place. great hosts. Five stars place to stay in Rincon.
30206616,Response from Alan And Eileen,August,2020,Thank you for taking the time to leave such a wonderful review! We are so happy to hear The Beach Pad is the best place you've stayed in Rincon. We strive to always provide high quality accommodations and service.

30206616,Response from Alan And Eileen,July,2020,Thank you for the amazing review. Nani!
30206616,Response from Alan And Eileen,June,2020,The generator at The Beach Pad is our back up energy once our solar power has been consumed and only if city power is down or not delivering a high enough voltage. This ensures our guests always have power and are comfortable with A/C and electricity. We are sorry to hear the noise bothered you during your trip! It is not always in use. only as a back up.Show more

30206616,Eunice,March,2019,Alan + Eileen were wonderful hosts. We had a lovely weekend with our 12 yr old and our 8 yr old boys. Location is most definitely a plus. we could easily walk to restaurants and great beaches. The BBQ rooftop area was perfect and we enjoyed nice family dinner with no hassles. The place is ample enough for a family of 4. has everything you need and is sparkling clean. We would definitely come back!
30206616,Jenna,March,2019,Alan & Eileen were amazing hosts! Anything you needed they were quick to respond and cared a lot about us enjoying our trip. They also have a house manager named Angelo who was more then great helping us since we did not rent a car he was able to pick us up and take us back to the air port and also took us into town for groceries and so on! The Airbnb is in the perfect location in Rinc√≥n just a short walk to the beach and bars! Extremely clean place with a lot of character. We would stay there again in a heart beat.
30206616,Jill,March,2019,Clean. cute spot a short walk from beautiful Sandy Beach. Lots of bars and restaurants around. but quiet enough inside the loft. And comfy beds and A/C. so you‚Äôll sleep well! Would highly recommend for a stay in Rincon.
30206616,Angela,February,2019,The Beach Pad is centrally located in Rincon in a great area. right next to Casa Verde and very close to other bars and restaurants. It's within walking distance to the beach. bars. restaurants. and nightlife. The accommodations themselves are new and very clean. Beach towels provided as well as shampoo / conditioner / soap. Cooler was also provided. but you might want to bring your own beach chair if you can. Rent a car for the Rincon area but stay at the Beach Pad for a very nice. clean. safe home away from home. Can't wait to go back next year!
30206616,Alex,January,2019,These units are very comfortable. clean and steps away from the beach and entertainment. A 5 star place in my book. Thank you Alan and Eileen for your hospitality. See you again soon.
30206616,Salina,January,2019,Right in the heart of all of the fun and steps to the beach. Clean. convenient. stylish. and super nice hosts that were not intrusive but very welcoming and available when we had questions. This is the perfect spot if you want to be able to wake up take a few steps to get some coffee and a bite and spend the day at the beach. So relaxing. The locals are awesome and the beach is safe and clean. Bring a beach towel and some coffee creamer :) Go to the Sushi Pool Bar. Jacks Shack and Copa Llena. Tamboo is a fun beach bar with standard food and some puerto rican cuisine. Check out the pink bus near Maria‚Äôs beach when you for sunset.

33349575,Krishna,December,2022,John and Annette were very accommodating of our requests. The Airbnb was beautiful and well maintained.
33349575,Martin,July,2022,Loved everything about our stay at Lions Gate. The entire property is pleasing to the eye as soon as you open the door. The pictures are nice but I don‚Äôt think they do this place justice!There is a balcony which makes for a wonderful time to catch a breeze & where you can take awesome pictures! Annette & John are great hosts. They were quick to answer any questions. Also Loved how Annette made it a point to introduce herself to us. classy! If you‚Äôre looking to have a great time in Rincon on a lovely property book this place immediately if it available when your are in town... you won‚Äôt regret it!
33349575,Isabella,April,2022,This is our second time staying and we loved it as much as the first time. We loved the hospitality & friendliness. We loved sitting in the balcony. you could hear the birds sing while looking at the ocean. Me and my partner loved every minute of it. The studio has all you need and is spacious. Most definitely will stay again üå±
33349575,Brian,April,2022,Great location. You can get to the beach or town easily from here. It‚Äôs gated too. which made us feel safe. Nice little peakaboo view of the ocean from the balcony and the yard and surrounding area was beautiful and taken care of.  Place was clean and tidy. John was great about communicating quickly with us and helpful in pointing out good restaurants. Only negative thing I can say is there aren‚Äôt any beach towels or much to cook with. so if you plan on cooking make sure buy everything you need in the kitchen to cook.
33349575,Alexander,March,2022,This is an amazing property with an incredible view and even better hosts. Don‚Äôt miss out!
33349575,Tiara,February,2022,Such a wonderful Airbnb! We loved staying there. It‚Äôs located on a beautiful property and very close to the beach.

The studio is very private and comfortable. and I had everything I needed and more. I would definitely recommend!
33349575,Adam,January,2022,Annette and John were so kind and accommodating. It was a great place. definitely was worth the extended stay!

33349575,Jeancarlo,September,2021,Everything was great! Loved the space. the privacy. the tranquility. Super comfortable. just what we needed! Hosts were on top of things. we very much enjoyed our stay :)
33349575,Norein,July,2021,Lovely place!!!
33349575,Melanie,July,2021,Great place. The property is beautiful with its giant ceiba tree and Bonsais prepared by the owner. Just a 4-6 minute drive from town and the best beaches Rincon has to offer. The apartment is clean and cozy. With everything you might need. Annette and her husband are wonderful and are always available for a chat and to answer any questions. Definitely recommend staying!
33349575,Norein,July,2021,Great view!!! Perfect beach suite!!
33349575,Jessi,June,2021,We really enjoyed our stay at Lion's Gate. The villa was exactly as described the grounds were even more beautiful than we expected. Rooms were clean and check-in was easy. Good location. quiet. but not far from downtown. Annette was kind enough to give us some suggestions for places to eat! 10/10 would stay again!
33349575,Barbs,June,2021,Amazing apartment with an amazing view! Very close to el pueblo of Rincon which made the experience even better!
33349575,Jason,May,2021,We stayed here for 5 days and 4 nights for a surf trip with one of my buddies.  This Airbnb exceeded our expectations.  First thing you notice is the beautiful gates adorned with with two lions when you approach the entrance.  Once the gate opens. you are greeted with a beautifully kept grounds with trees. flowers. bonsai trees. big trees. and a very chill dog.  The studio is above the garage. checkin in was a breeze.  First thing we noticed was how clean and spacious the studio was.  AC works great.  We used the futon as a second bed which was comfortable.  Main bed was very comfortable.  Balcony with a view of the ocean a plus.  And again I can‚Äôt emphasize how clean the place was.  I‚Äôve stayed at many Airbnb‚Äôs and this was clearly the winner for cleanliness.  Full kitchen with basic cooking tools were available but we didn‚Äôt use it.The location here was perfect for our surf trip.  You are in the hills above rincon in a quite residential neighborhood.  Gas station/convenience store about 2 min drive away.  About 6 minutes away from domes beach. we beat the crowds every morning by getting there at the crack of dawn.  Swell got bigger on the north shore of the island so we drove to Aguadilla a bunch of times during our trip. taking about 40-50 minutes each way.  The only down side I can say about Annette‚Äôs place is that the WiFi isn‚Äôt the fastest. but hey. we were here to surf and surf only. so we didn‚Äôt really care.  Our cell signal was pretty good in the studio.  Annette was around to give us suggestions and answer any questions we had.  Overall I would HIGHLY recommend coming here if you‚Äôre going to be in Rincon.Show more
33349575,Calith,May,2021,The place and hosts were excellent. I recommend a 100%!
33349575,,MayteApril,2021,Annette place is very peaceful and comfortable. as well as very secure (Main gate entrance and security cameras around the property). Ms. Annette is very attentive. kind and always willing to help you with any concerns/questions. She lives in the property with her husband and they are both around during the day if you need them. There is a beautiful Ceiba tree right in front of this apartment. and a bunch of really pretty bonsais around the property.The apartment is very clean and well maintained. just as you see in the pictures. The balcony was my favorite place. Having breakfast in the morning is a nice experience with the ocean view. The apartment is also very breeze. and even the doors have screens. At night we didn't even need to turn on the AC. as the breeze really cools down the apartment. There is a cute dog (Luna) around the property. but even though she seems very sweet. she did not say hi as I think she is very shy.We really enjoyed our time in this property. and we are definitely looking forward to come back in the future!Show more

We will forever be grateful for the way they treated us.  The view from the balcony is breathtaking!!  The check in /check out process was extremely simple and convenient.  We will 1000% be returning to visit asap!!  You can tell that Annette & John put in the extra effort to ensure their guests feel at home.  The property is filled with beautiful colorful plants and flawless landscaping.  You will feel like royalty entering the front gates. I promise!  The unit itself was phenomenal. everything looked new and top quality.  The bed was super comfortable. shower head was one of the nicest I have come across in Rincon. the kitchen was perfect and had everything we needed.  Their dog Luna is the sweetest ever. she is a little shy. but eventually warms up to you and you can‚Äôt get enough! The A/C was very new and worked perfect. they also have fans if you prefer. The wi-fi worked well. They provide an iron and ironing board if you need. They were so thoughtful to include a binder and laminated sheets of useful information about Rincon (restaurants. activities. etc.) Annette & John made us feel like family. we will miss them!Show more

33349575,Nick,January,2020,Expect a great experience staying at Annette's studio! It's much bigger than expected and offers gorgeous views of the ocean and surrounding area. It's a quick drive to the local surf spots or restaurants and is within walking distance to most places as well! Definitely recommend staying with Annette when in Rincon!

638921538365153378,Ross,September,2022,Good:The place is modern. clean. and in close proximity to the beach and a few very nice restaurants. The AC worked wonderfully and temperature was very comfortable. There is a TV in the bedroom. Private spot. areas to relax outside. and parking on site. Good value for the area. Bad:Owners gave us the door code to check in and that‚Äôs where communication stopped. We had a few issues with the place when we arrived and reached out to the owners via Airbnb app AND cell phone (called) which I received no reply. The issues were: - No password for the Wi-Fi. There is internet. but without the password we weren‚Äôt able to connect. Which is important as I had no cell service on the property (AT&T). - The toilet in the main bathroom would not flush. The toilet just filled up with water when flushed. So we had to use the half bathroom to go number 1 and 2. Also learned this after I had already used the toilet so this was a bit of a rough start. - The sink in the main bathroom did not drain. The drain was stuck closed. Again. not ideal. But there was a half bathroom with a working sink we could use. - The window in the kitchen was stuck open. Allowing mosquitos to come inside all day and night. - Not a lot of amenities in the house. No bottle opener. No shades on the windows. No iron/steamer for clothes. No instructions or information about the surrounding area (not a big deal if you have Wi-Fi or cell service. which we did not). All things we could do without but some of those touches would be nice for people who are visiting from far away and living out of a suitcase.  Overall I would say the property has a lot of pros and a lot of cons. Definitely has some elements of a very nice Airbnb but needs some TLC and personal touches to make guest feel comfortable. Bottom line: fix your plumbing and communication.Show more
638921538365153378,Evelyn,August,2022,This was such an amazing getaway. Loved the location and the bungalow was WONDERFUL. 5 min walk to the beach. Lovely location. Can not wait to go back
638921538365153378,Autumn,August,2022,We had a separate Airbnb fall through and messaged Hector last minute. asking if we could stay at this sweet little cottage.We were over the moon about his quick reply because we remembered staying at this location 6 years ago and have fond memories of it.It has been given a facelift but it's still as quaint and perfect as it was in the past.The proximity to the beach. while still offering privacy is perfection.The horses just across the road from the property brought my girls so much joy. The brunch a short walk away and at the beach was amazing each morning.We'll be back for sure! Book a stay while in Rincon. You won't regret it.
638921538365153378,Marisol,July,2022,Great place and location! It was very close to the beach and restaurants! I love Rinc√≥n PR! There was no internet available during my stay which was a little annoying but overall it was a pleasant stay!

638921538365153378,Margot,June,2022,It feels like being in a cozy. country side home. Brand new furniture and electrical appliances. Comfortable beds.  Take an eye mask if you need a dark room to sleep. There are no curtains or blackout shades. Nice location within a 2 min. walk to the beach.  Kitchenette has limited cooking utensils .one pot and one pan. (At least I did not see anymore).  One of the most memorable Air BnB  locations I have been to.

10030968,Sarah,June,2021,Do not stay here I booked here just for the 4th floor balcony room and was informed 2 days before checkin that we were getting the bottom floor room. The AC had 1 temperature which was freezing and the floor was sandy now matter how much you cleaned off your feet. Go to a hotel for the same price this wasn‚Äôt worth it.
10030968,Monique,April,2021,A lovely. quiet place surrounded by greenery and tranquility. We enjoy Rincon so much. and staying here made it all the more special.

10030968,Genesis,July,2016,Great Experience at Serenity. Sarah was a great host. The room was big. everything in Rincon is basically near in the 413 road. It was clean. the place was so peaceful and since I'm local I'll definitely stay here again. Keep up with the good work!
10030968,Najeeb,June,2016,Sara was very inviting and helpful - she gave us direction on where to eat. beaches to go. and how to get around. Awesome hostess. We came in at  3am and they were accommodating for that. no problem.  The room was very clean. AC is cold. and the beds very comfortable. No view of the ocean from this room due to trees. etc. but the view is beautiful nonetheless.  The location was awesome. Not quite in the town of RINCON. which I wouldnt want to stay in. but in a hub in SANDY BEACH area which is super cool. and a little secluded. near all the right spots. and a 10min drive to town.   Good sushi place nearby. and TAMBOO for drinks and hangout. and the BEACH HOUSE restaurant for drinks and just about any meal you need (B. L. D).  Overall the experience was awesome. It's exactly what we needed and wanted - with the freedom to come in and out as desired. and the friendliness you want from the locals.   We could'nt have asked for more. Thanks Serenity. 100% will be returning to this place.Show more
10030968,Susan,March,2016,Absolutely wonderful- we loved our stay at Serenity. The room was delightful. all communication easy- will definitely return. Sara is the perfect host!!
10030968,Amanda,March,2016,Sara was great. She gave us many recommendations for the area and makes a mean scrambled egg. Totally worth going upstairs in the morning to check out the view and snag a bite to eat. The location of Serenity is perfect for those that want to surf. relax on the beach and be near the nightlife. A very short walk to bars. food and Sandy Beach. The room was clean and very up-to-date. We stayed at one of the resorts in Rincon and it was nowhere near as nice. My husband and I plan to go back and will definitely be staying at Serenity again.
10030968,Laura,March,2016,It was amazing! This space is so modern and well equipped with everything you could possibly need.
10030968,Danielle,February,2016,We had an amazing experience at Serenity. The owner. Sarah. was extremely helpful and accommodating. The room was very spacious and was only a few minute walk to the beach! What more can you ask for? Thank you Sarah!
10030968,Chelsea,February,2016,Sara. the hotel manager. was one of the best I've seen in the hospitality industry. She was incredibly friendly and accommodating. My parents were here visiting me. and she made sure they were well taken care of. 10/10 would stay again!
10030968,Tawnia,February,2016,Sara was amazing!  She sent us emails before we got there and then welcomed us when we arrived.  She showed us our room and then gave us directions around the area. including great restaurants. swimming beaches and markets.  The restaurants she recommended were excellent and the Thursday night Rincon artists' market was a treat.  The room was ridiculously amazing...way bigger than photos showed. relaxing atmosphere. and pretty much paradise.  Will definitely be going back to this little piece of heaven!
10030968,Sumitra,February,2016,Lovely and peaceful accommodation in a great Rincon location - easy walking distance to Sandy Beach and some excellent restaurants (would recommend Pool Bar Sushi. Saltaire. and Tamboo). The ocean view room was spacious. was super clean with modern furnishings. had a nice terrace to relax on in the evenings. and had nice comfortable beds. Sara was a great host to us and very friendly. I hope we have the opportunity to return to Serenity!
10030968,Noah,February,2016,Serenity was great. It's really clean and nicely renovated. Sara was extremely friendly and accommodating. Our room was huge. clean. and cozy. Plus the location is great: easy walk to the beach and quick drive to lots of places. You will feel well taken care of here.

10030968,Yaritza,January,2016,I really enjoyed the stay at Serenity!  It was beautiful. clean and comfortable! The service received by Laura the manager and her staff were outstanding and they were always available and very nice!
10030968,Justine,January,2016,Laura. the general manager. is great!!! She makes your experience at Senerity even better :) The hotel is extremely well located. close to restaurants and bar and 5 min walk from the very nice Sandy Beach. in Rincon (Puntas area).We had an amazing time at Serenity!!
10030968,Helen,December,2015,My daughter I stayed at Serenity as some of the first guests. Securing a room was easy and Laura. the host. was attentive from the start. When we arrived. she made it clear that there were still a few loose ends in getting this new hotel up and going. Our beautiful new flatscreen was not set up. and she began to work on that. The room was impressive from the start. The 2 beds were huge. with beautiful bedding and modern headboards that made me want to do the same thing at home. There was a cute balcony with a view of the ocean which my college aged daughter used frequently to get some work done. Our hot water was not getting very hot and Laura offered us a shower in the vacant room next door which worked out fine. A workman came in and got the hot water going on day 2. This hotel has been completely rehabbed from whatever it was before. It is set up on top of a pretty steep hill but I always enjoy a little cardio activity after a meal which brings me to my next point. The restaurant located just a short walk from the hotel is The Sushi Pool Bar which is excellent! It's super laid back and the sushi is out of this world. I loved trading in my wet beach towel at the end of the day for a fluffy new one ready for the next day. Hopefully . the restaurant on the top will open in coming days as it has a fabulous view of the water. I highly recommend Serenity if you want a fresh. bright hotel with good vibes but don't mind a good steep.walk up and down. (Parking is plentiful too but you don't want to drive to the beach-gotta hoof it. but it's not far). We hope to stay again in the future!   Show more

50655278,Mebane,February,2022,Awesome location next to the main square! Little funky surf shack. couple of little things not working but overall solid and host was great communicating. If town crowded. street parking is tough but there's a parking lot only a block or so away on other side of town square...
50655278,Rhys And Geri,January,2022,Great spot for a central Rincon experience. It was a really fun change for us as we typically stay around Puntas. The house is standalone and seconds walking distance to awesome Panaderia sandwiches. good coffee. and lots of places to eat/drink/Art Walk. Pharmacy around the corner. The place is very comfortable. clean. and with a cool artsy vibe. The front patio is great for hanging out. Tony is a great host. too.
50655278,Eric,December,2021,AT HOME IN RINCON. PUERTO RICORincon has some of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen.Narrow strips of golden sand shaded by overhanging palms providing plenty of protection from the blazing sunSurfers skittering among the breaking waves; snorkelers in the gentler waters among the reefs.Tony‚Äôs home in a choice location on a side street off the town square in Rincon is a short walk from the town beach and a short (12 minute) drive from a nature preserve and five of the most famous surfing beaches in the Caribbean (including Domes & Steps). Most evenings we walked to a beach to watch the sun‚Äôs nightly bath in the sea. There are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. The best restaurant is Stella‚Äôs. just outside the main part of town.When you stay at Tony‚Äôs. you are staying in a home in the local community. not some antiseptic impersonal hotel room. Tony‚Äôs is a clean and well-kept. one-story house with 3 large bedrooms with queen beds and a large living-dining area. Our favorite place to hang out. however. was the equally large covered porch. which has lounge and dining areas. as well as a gas grill. Tony‚Äôs home was well-decorated with paintings by local artists and a lot of plants. We recognized some of the plants from home. but these were much larger and healthier. There was little traffic and plenty of on-street parking on the narrow. one-way street while we were there. despite it being a holiday week during the peak tourist season.Tony is a well-respected businessman in the community and owns several rental dwellings. He is attentive and helpful. There was a decorated Christmas tree in the living room. He found a great surfing instructor for my daughter and her friend ‚Äì Wico from Brooklyn works for Nico in Rincon during the winter surf season! Wico took them to a secret beach to avoid the crowds.We just had a great. relaxing time!Show more

I am a little surprised by some of your comments given that you asked to extend your stay. and didn't bring any of your concerns to my attention  during your stay. when I could have addressed them for you. but nonetheless I will take your sentiments to heart and work harder to ensure a comfortable stay for future guests.  Thank you again and I hope that you give us another chance in the future.Show more

10612630,Jovonna,July,2021,This place had all the extra touches you could need or want for some much needed beach time in Rincon. We took advantage of the beach chairs and towels and were delighted to come home every day to a plush. comfy. big bed. The sunsets from the patio were also lovely to watch and we enjoyed the great location - walking distance or a short drive to many local restaurants and amazing beaches.
10612630,Breana,July,2021,Hands down the best Airbnb I‚Äôve stayed in. The location was perfect. the king size bed was awesome and the aircon was sooo refreshing after a long day at the beach! 10/10 would recommend!

10612630,Anthony,May,2021,The place was exactly as in the pictures. Bed was soft and plush. AC made you feel you was in Antarctica lol. -and. has washer and dryer which was a plus! Ivan was well communicated. extremely understanding and made me feel like I was right at home.Location prime to all the beaches.. and Ivan provides everything you need. towels. chairs. cooler and even beach toys. I will stay again!
10612630,Laura,May,2021,Great central location a few minutes drive to many beaches (Sandy Beach. Maria's Beach. Domes Beach. etc.) and restaurants (Beach House. Red Flamboy√°n. etc). A heads up that there are no sidewalks so even though the distances aren't far to beaches and restaurants. it is safer and more common to drive places. The AC and internet worked great!Ivan had beach towels. beach chairs. beach toys for kids. and a frisbee. which we appreciated being able to use. The hot tub currently isn't working and Ivan confirmed we were okay with this before accepting our reservation. which we appreciated.As far as cooking goes. there are pots and pans of different sizes. cooking utensils. a coffee maker & filters. plates. bowls. etc. Bring your own salt. pepper. oil. coffee. etc.

10612630,Cyndi,January,2017,Spacious for the family of four. No problem with privacy. We love the jetted tub. The washer is not working when we first arrive but they have it fixed in right away. The care taker is nice. You can walk to the beach and some eating place. Few mins drive to town. We appreciate the extras too like beach towels. chairs etc. all in all we are satisfied and happy with this place.

47596141,Orlando,October,2022,Everything was great and the views are spectacular. Coralis was very responsive and the staff very kind and friendly. very clean and with good a/c and sealing fans. phone charges (no type C) . taking breakfast (included and delicious)  in  front of the beach was out of this world. The sunset is stunning. you can not miss it. The only thing that would improve is the mattress. they are too firm. it was difficult to sleep well. They were really hard . I had to put pillows and wrap the quilt around them in my wife's side so she would sleep a little better. Mattress should be medium not to plush and not to firm for any kind of guest. That's my only consern but is very important. I hope they improve this so we can stay again because is a beautiful and relaxing place. Thanks.

36145629,Amelia,March 2023We booked this rental on April 10.,2022,. Our dates were 3/9/23 - 3/14/23. When I first messaged Dianna about booking this location I explained to her why we were booking it. for our daughters quinceanera. She never told me about an event fee until after we booked it. She then told me that it covered tables. bar ( no bartender) . and event area ( that is open to use anyways) .  She didn't tell me until January of 2023 that she in fact didn't have tables. So we had to rush to find tables and chairs for the party. I asked for confirmation on the 2 houses and studio apartment of which she confirmed. Our first night on the property we were told not to use the studio apartment because there was a busted pipe. I then found a man on the property that was not with our party. Come to find out he was renting the studio. We called and she wanted us to just use a futon in another house. We refused to. we paid for the entire property. We also contacted her about a broken ac with no response.

36145629,We booked this rental on,April 10.,2022,. Our dates were 3/9/23 - 3/14/23. When I first messaged Dianna about booking this location I explained to her why we were booking it. for our daughters quinceanera. She never told me about an event fee until after we booked it. She then told me that it covered tables. bar ( no bartender) . and event area ( that is open to use anyways) .  She didn't tell me until January of 2023 that she in fact didn't have tables. So we had to rush to find tables and chairs for the party. I asked for confirmation on the 2 houses and studio apartment of which she confirmed. Our first night on the property we were told not to use the studio apartment because there was a busted pipe. I then found a man on the property that was not with our party. Come to find out he was renting the studio. We called and she wanted us to just use a futon in another house. We refused to. we paid for the entire property. We also contacted her about a broken ac with no response.
36145629,Lara,December,2022,Dianna's place is gorgeous! The upper house has beautiful views. The whole place is spacious with lots of rooms. If you are going on a trip with a very big group. this is the place to be. It is close to restaurants and bars. The only thing to be mindful of is not to make too much noise after a certain hour. But overall. very relaxing and we had a great stay!
36145629,Response from Dianna,October,2022,Thanks Sharmaine!
36145629,Emimarie,July,2022,This is an amazing property with breathtaking views. We had a group of 20 and there was enough room for everyone. No one felt cramped and we all had our own space. It is very close to the beach and has outdoor showers to rise the sand off. It‚Äôs also very close to restaurants and activities. We were pleasantly surprised to see the house had a backup generation that did kick-in during a quick brown out and it worked wonderfully. so that was a big plus.  The host. Dianna. was very welcoming. attentive and helpful. She answered any questions we may have had and gave us suggestions on restaurants and things to do while we were there. We really enjoyed our stay at The Ocean View Paradise and hope to return there in the near future!
36145629,DaVonne,July,2022,This is such a beautiful property and wonderful for large groups.
36145629,Response from Dianna,July,2022,It was a pleasure hosting your family!  I am so happy you had a great time at Ocean  View Paradise! Hope to see you again soon! Dianna
36145629,Erin,October,2021,We had a wonderful experience at Ocean View Paradise. It was a great place to have a destination wedding and perfect for all guests to stay in one place. It‚Äôs in a great location next to the beach. restaurants. and activities. Dianna was a great host.
36145629,Simon,October,2021,Such a beautiful place and Dianna was incredibly helpful and so accommodating. I highly recommend this stay.
36145629,Christopher,September,2021,This house was everything we expected.  very spacious for a large group. I would definitely stay here again
36145629,Response from Dianna,August,2021,I am sorry to here about the issues at the road level.. The problem is this is not my property.. but the entrance to my property.. The town has been asked to fix this issue but obviously nothing has been done..I will be back in PR in 2 weeks to follow up on the road problem. Thank you for being a great guest!  DiannaShow more
36145629,Todd,July,2021,House was great.  Location was close to everything you would want to do on the beach. snorkeling. surfing or just relaxing.

29543958,Mary,May,2022,This beach house is awesome... very clean. comfortable and convenient!  The deck chairs and porch are very conducive to relaxing and enjoying meals and games.  Hopefully on our next trip to Rincon it will be available.
29543958,Alex,May,2022,Great place to stay
29543958,Carol,February,2022,You will want for nothing at Mary‚Äôs place. Excellent host
29543958,Sean,March,2021,Spectacular sunsets. Very clean place. Host is accesible.
29543958,Geraldine,March,2021,We had a great time at this clean. beautiful location.   All you need is at the house and walking distance to places to eat and drink.    Great communication from Mary.
29543958,Coleman,March,2021,spotlessly clean. great location. secure and safe. spacious. well equipped. comfortable beds. a slice of heaven.
29543958,Erica,February,2021,Casa Serrano is a beach lovers dream! Everything and more that you could possibly need to make your stay complete! The location is spectacular. it gives a whole new meaning to beach side! The place itself was very clean and organized with everything you‚Äôd need. there was even a sewing kit which came in handy when my bathing suit ripped on the 2nd day of our stay! We had some minor hot water issues and they sent the maintenance man over within the hour!  ( the water valve was in the off position. so it was an easy fix) The place is situated very close to a supermarket within walking distance. along with center of town a short 5 minute drive! Thursday nights is the best time to venture in town to visit the art festival where the locals come out and sell their crafts. Overall I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better rental or better hosts! If your looking for a great beach stay. Don‚Äôt miss this one! Can‚Äôt wait to return  for another 5 star Relaxing vacation!!!!
29543958,Jes√∫s,November,2020,The house has everything you need and it is close to restaurants and supermarkets. The beach is beautiful and just a step outside of the house. I will definitely be back again soon.
29543958,Manuel,November,2020,Great view and awesome location close to a lot of food places and attractions
29543958,Rey,October,2020,Perfect spot. the beach in front of the house. beautiful sunsets !
29543958,Aaron,September,2020,Super clean. great service and outstanding location. You can finish breakfast and walk straight to the beach that‚Äôs backyard. Great night view too. We will be going back.
29543958,Zach,August,2020,The location is incredible. apart from the obvious in front of the ocean which is extremely convenient to be able to just walk out to the beach whenever you want. but also it‚Äôs very close to a food truck park and a famous beach bar. I ran on the beach each morning. the experience with the family was excellent!
29543958,Benjamin,July,2020,Super clean. great location. Everything we needed they had. Will definitely go back.
29543958,Response from Mary,July,2020,Juan glad you enjoyed yourself! Thank you for the feedback! Hopefully we will see you again!
29543958,Allie,March,2020,Can't beat the location. Beach front is the best! Great swimming beach right outside the gate. Easy access to grocery stores and town is just a few minutes drive away! Plan on spending most of your time on the deck or in the yard. too nice to stay inside!
29543958,Marli,February,2020,Such a great beach house!  We had everything we needed and the location couldn‚Äôt have been better!  We‚Äôre already talking about plans for our next trip and we‚Äôll definitely be staying here.
29543958,Response from Mary,January,2020,Stefan i am sorry that your stay was not up to par. we always strive to satisfy all our customers.  I wish you would have communicated about these issues.  The water problem would have been fixed.  Also we would have spoken to the renters on the upper level about volume control. But without us knowing there were theses issues we could not improve your stay.  We appreciate your feedback!Show more
29543958,Denise,December,2019,My family enjoyed 3 nights at Mary's place!  The location was perfect!  We enjoyed listening to the waves each night!  The listing is accurate.  Her place has everything you need for a fabulous time on the beach.
29543958,Lymari,September,2019,This house is super clean and it has everything you need! The location is perfect and the views are beautiful. My family had an awesome time!
29543958,Response from Mary,September,2019,Thank you for the awesome review! We aim to please!  We will be happy to have you on your next visit & hopefully we will be on the same page!  ;)
29543958,Dmitry,August,2019,The unit is small. so the only dining place is on the deck. Location is great. but security cameras... especially the one on top of the dining table looking at the whole deck can cause some discomfort. Not sure if it was active or not. but at least once I've seen red LEDs from infrared light were on.
29543958,Carlos,June,2019,Great place to stay. awesome view. quick access to the beach. Very close to downtown. food truck park. and grocery store. Owners are very quick to respond. we ran out of gas for the stove just before breakfast. we called and everything was solved with a new gas tank within 30 minutes. Overall awesome experience. Definitely stay here again when visiting Rincon.
29543958,Ian,April,2019,Great place to stay in Rincon. walking distance to one of the best bars (villa confresi) and a short drive to many great surf spots. I highly recommend this place and will definitely stay here again!
29543958,Mike,April,2019,Great location!  We have stayed in Rincon several times over the years - specifically in the stretch of beach Mary's place is on.  We have always walked down to just  in front of Mary's house to swim - it is one of the sandiest. non-rocky locations compared to the beach in front of other houses that get 'rocky' very close to shore.  Nice to have 3 bedrooms (several houses in area only have 2) that all have good working air conditioners.  Security is very good and makes use of key code locks vs. physical keys being issued.  Highly recommend!
29543958,Eric,March,2019,The place is beautiful and everyone enjoyed the direct access to the beach. There were beach chairs and sand toys a plenty! The sunsets are breathtaking. and just a short beach walk away is a restaurant and bar with pina coladas to go!
29543958,Helena,March,2019,A perfect vacation house. Nice. tidy. comfortable beds and an amazing ocean view. Mary is very nice and thoughtful. My best recommodations!
29543958,Melanie,February,2019,Loved our stay so much we decided to book an extra day! The views and location was so much better than I expected! The house was spacious and very very clean! Beach chairs and beach umbrella available for guest use was a plus! Mary was a great host and responded quickly to messages I sent. Will definitely be booking this home again in our next visit to Rincon. but for a longer stay.
29543958,Response from Mary,February,2019,Glad you enjoyed your stay! Keep us in mind for future vacations!
29543958,Response from Mary,March,2019,Thank you Brian for the feedback!  Glad you enjoyed your stay!  keep us in mind for the future!
29543958,Karina,January,2019,Mary is a great host. My family and I loved the house. the amenities. the location. the view. This is a kid friendly house. Very comfortable. The amenities and beach items available made our beach vacation a breeze.Mary was flexible with us and communication with her was easy and quick. This is a house worth staying at over and over again. We appreciate all that Mary and her team has done for the property. and for our fantastic stay. Thank you! We hope to come back next year.
29543958,Sonymarie,January,2019,We really enjoyed the property and the amazing sunsets!!  And the hammock was strategically placed in the terrace! The property pics were accurate and a lot of key things (like spices and laundry detergent!) were included. The A/C worked great. The wifi did give a little problem but Mary answered the messages very quickly! Thanks Mary!!The best was the view!!!! The sunsets were priceless!! It also has direct access to a small beach literally by the side of the house.This is one of those properties that we will definitely visit again!!
29543958,Melissa,January,2019,Thank you Mary for all your help and responsiveness during our stay. Casa Serrano is a great place to stay not only for tourists. but also for us locals who want to stay and vacation in our island. We really hope to go back and stay again soon!

29543958,Karem,January,2020,Great view. literally in the ocean. No luxuries but just necessary. The house is super clean and with everything you'll need. The beach is excellent. only that the road that is right next to the house can enter anyone. It's a matter of being careful. We were just unlucky that the last night the electricity service went out for 9 hours and we weren't able to sleep. As much as highly recommended. great.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

42763428,Felipe,April,2022,Very gorgeous place! Perfect spot near everything you need for a perfect stay. We loved and now we‚Äôre missing all the nature surrounding our camper. Very clean and well decorated. Pool is a most after a long day at beach. 100% recommended. im sure will be back soon.
42763428,Dean,March,2022,Tbh ! It was great
42763428,Colton,March,2022,Ingrids place is wonderful. It is within walking distance to Rincon plaza (3mins) and within walking distance to the beach (~8-10minutes). The outdoor space is beautiful with a private pool. lush greenery. an outdoor kitchen and shower. and relaxing hammocks. The inside is snug but the bed is comfortable and everything clean. I would definitely stay again!
42763428,Victor I,February,2022,Its a great stay very close to the plaza of Rincon where everything is also while staying The gas for the grill finished and she responded very quick and sent someone to take care pf it in a timely manner so Recommend 100% Recomendado para todos Ingrid fue un host espectacular y respondi√≥ a toda necesidad que teniamos mientras nos quedamos y la pasamos super bien!

42763428,Priscila,November,2021,This is truly an Oasis.  Very clean and comfortable.  We had all we needed for a relaxing getaway.  Love how it was pretty quiet. but we were still 3 minutes away from the town plaza.  Love being surrounded by all the fruiting plants (bananas. plantains. jobo. aloe. rosemary. scallions. oregano. passion fruit. etc.) and hearing the birds.  Even if it rains. it is still very nice.  Highly recommend it.  I can't wait to be back.
42763428,Ingrid,October,2021,Amazing stay with a private pool that has an amazing ambient where you can just stay and relax at all day or just walk to the downtown area to have some fun. As to the location. the stay is super close to the downtown area and has everything you can ask for at walking distance (from restaurants. to pharmacies. you name it).
42763428,Hector,September,2021,üå†üå†üå†üå†üå†
42763428,Federico,August,2021,In general is a nice place to stay. but there‚Äôre some issues. The first impression you have when you enter the gate is two  ‚Äúthree floors houses‚Äù on the back. so my wife and I we didn‚Äôt felt the privacy we wanted on the commons areas. There were neighbors looking at us while using the pool and the seat next to it. even though they have some curtains in some areas. Some  of the neighbors were noisy too.The RV and areas are clean. the pool is good. So in overall leaving the neighbors out is a nice place!
42763428,Oswald,August,2021,Beautiful place! Amazing location. Looking forward to another stay in the near future
42763428,Melissa,July,2021,We  had a GREAT time. The camper is super clean. the linen and towels were clean. the air conditioning work super. the bathroom is outside the camper and is very nice and clean too.This was our first experience in a camper and have to say that was beyond our expectations and we hope that our next experiences and owners be like Ingrid! We look forward to repeat our stay!
42763428,Sylvia,June,2021,This is one of the most beautiful and organic places I have ever stayed in. I like that it‚Äôs surrounded by nature and it‚Äôs located in a pretty quiet neighborhood. Place is sparkling clean and has al the basics

42763428,Christopher,April,2021,Hear me out:Arrive early enough to Rinc√≥n. preferably before check-in... go to any supermarket nearby (around 3-5 minutes far from the camper) to do necessary groceries (don‚Äôt buy TOO MUCH food. you‚Äôll probably end up wanting to go to every restaurant in Rinc√≥n üòÇüòÇüòÇ food there is gooood! )... get early enough to the camper. around 3:30pm.. so you have plenty of time and sun to enjoy it either inside the pool or by the pool sitting on a patio chair. while being accompanied by a cold drink...Around 6:15pm enjoy Rinc√≥n‚Äôs sunset while laying on the hammock and relaxing to the light ocean breeze and to the ‚Äúeveryday is Friday‚Äù vibes all around the town. By then. you should have made a reservation on one of your top 5 restaurants to visit during the stay. or you also could have made groceries for your dinner (there are pl√°nanos by the camper! Yeah. the ones used to make ‚Äúmofongo‚Äù ü§´) . Either you go out and have an amazing dinner with an amazing view... or you have an amazing dinner homemade. also with an amazing view to the starry skies!If its weekend. you should get ready after dinner and go enjoy music and handcrafted jewelry made by local artists. during that time don‚Äôt forget you are in Rinc√≥n. you are on vacations... HAVE SOME FUN!! Beside all this. get creative. put your own touch into this vacations and repeat this dose everyday... Thank me later üçæ!Show more

42763428,Luz,July,2021,You'll find more than what you see.First. the town is accessible for both food places. beaches. pharmacies. gas stations. supermarkets and a pleasant atmosphere at night in the square.Second is private. it was a stay with my partner and we had a quiet time and despite the fact that there are neighbors not so close we never saw them the whole time we were in the stay. Third. we thought it was going to be small because the photos don't let you appreciate it. but the entrance is wide and you can park comfortably. The size pool is excellent. It has a table with an umbrella where we had breakfast in the mornings and it was nice to do so. It has a BBQ and next to a sink which was very comfortable and they provide the basic and necessary utensils to make you food. It has a space that has a swing and a hammock where you feel at peace since you take it to relax. It also has a separate bathroom which is super large and comfortable. And to finish the camper. the bed is a good size and not uncomfortable yet you have space to put your things and it also has a spacious couch. The air worked really well.Communication with Ingrid was accurate and everything is so well explained that you don't need to be writing all the time. in particular in my stay we had no mishap and it was better than we expected. I recommend it and would still stay when I want to be in Rincon again.Show moreTranslated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

25716672,Belinda,July,2022,The views from Amapola house are stunning! We arrived late at night and had no idea just how beautiful our view would be in the morning!! We were definitely surprised with the view when we explored the following morning. Neighbors were nice and helpful.
25716672,Sabian,June,2022,Amazing Stay!
25716672,Connie,April,2022,We had a wonderful stay with our family of 7! The views from the rooftop are breath taking and better than the photos. The place is so spacious and comfortable. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked! Highly recommend!
25716672,Rikki,April,2022,We really enjoyed our stay at the Amapola House! We arrived late night and the arrival information was seamless. The house was clean and we had plenty of space for our group of 4 adults and 4 kids. The rooftop has a beautiful view and we enjoyed watching the sunset up there. The kids loved the pool! The location really is perfect. We enjoyed getting coffee and smoothies at Jakes at the bottom of the hill. Communication was wonderful and we really appreciated all the recommendations!  I would highly recommend staying here. We had a blast and we would definitely rent the Amapola house again! Thank you Nicole & Heather!
25716672,Chris,March,2022,Awesome place!! Bedrooms are comfy. great views upstairs and the pool is a cherry on top
25716672,Ken,February,2022,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The home was clean and offered great comfort and amenities; all as advertised. When we needed to communicate with Nicole or Heather we received immediate responses. The view from the upstairs deck and the roof top pool are unique and afforded beautiful sunset views after busy days at the beach. Dining and beaches are so close to Amapola House; it's all about location. location. location! We would certainly stay there again.
25716672,Jessica,January,2022,Great stay at the Amapola House. It's in a perfect spot for sunsets and has beautiful views from every floor. Grill worked great and  there were some beach day items that came in handy. Note the pool doesn't get much sunlight and was cold all hours of the day. The house is missing some kitchen items and isn't the best for cooking in at home. Water pressure isn't great but it could be because of the location atop a hill. Rooms get cold and we all slept well. It's a good spot for the value and we were really happy with the location. close to beaches. walking distance to coffee and has a nice outdoor shower right by the driveway to help keep everyone clean.
25716672,John,January,2022,The Amapola house was exactly as advertised. beautiful and in prime location to local beaches and shops. Our group of 7 had a great time here but unfortunately we did not have running water the majority of our stay. Nicole & heather were extremely responsive and helped in every way they could including issuing us a partial refund for which we are very appreciative. The house was clean. the AC worked great and the view from the roof was spectacular. Apart from the water situation which wasn‚Äôt ideal this was a great stay and our group made the best of it. We did not know that this was somewhat of a common occurrence in Rincon so I would just make that more clear but again overall a great stay.
25716672,Anthony,January,2022,Wonderful place to spend your time. The view is magnificent and the property is spacious.
25716672,Ryan,November,2021,Great spot in a great location convenient to everything .Will be back !!!!!
25716672,Nicole,August,2021,Great location and beautiful home. You can walk to the beach and restaurants. and after a day in the sun. the pool is the perfect place to unwind and relax.
25716672,Christi,July,2021,You can expect to fully relax here. The roof top plunge pool in the morning is soooooo peaceful. hell-anytime of the day. We didn‚Äôt need anything while here. Thanks for a lovely stay!
25716672,Daniel,June,2021,Excellent spot! Wish I was there again right now. If you look closely in the trees you may spot an iguana munching on some flowers! That was really cool.
25716672,Liceth,June,2021,This is a great house that I would definitely go to again. The view is amazing and the rooftop was our favorite part. An amazing pool. with lights and a bar right next to eat to sit and relax with friends and family. I loved it!
25716672,Response from Nicole & Heather,June,2021,Thank you so much. Gabriel! We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay at Amapola House. We hope you will come stay again soon!
25716672,Response from Nicole & Heather,June,2021,We want to thank you for taking the time to leave us a review.  We are so pleased that you enjoyed your time at Amapola House!  We hope that you will stay at Amapola House again in the near future!
25716672,Yahaira,May,2021,This house was an absolute pleasure to stay in! The views are breathtaking. Nicole and Heather were great hosts. and easy to communicate with. The pool on the roof was fun to hang put in at night with the lights on.
25716672,Cortez,May,2021,Thank you soooo much for having us!! These pictures does no justice for how amazing the house is in person!!! Lovely view and finding the 4th bdrm with my group was hilarious bc we thought we were psyched for a minute! üòÇ again. thank you for having us!
25716672,Kim,February,2021,This is nice home in Rincon. It is within walking distance to the coffee shop and bagel shop. although the walk back is super steep! For the price point and by the pics. we expected it to be a bit swankier. but all in all it is a beautiful well maintained home and the hosts are kind. helpful. and attentive. We would definitely stay here again :)
25716672,Elias,November,2020,This place has everything you‚Äôll need to fill at home.  Cozy. spacious. nicely decorated and with a privileged location.  Close to everything. while at the same time quiet and peaceful.Communication with owners was smooth. fast.  Big plus there.  I hope we can stay again and be able to enjoy the location once more. Casa Amapola is 100% recommended.
25716672,Annette,July,2020,This property is amazing. Clean. great view. has everything you need. The roof small pool was great and the rooms were very nice.  It accommodates 8 persons comfortable. There was detail during the stay. There are problems in the area with electricity. They even have solar power but not enough to supply energy to all ACs. First night we could only use three of the ACs and the second night there was.a power blackout in the area and we could not sleep due to the heat. This was completely out of their control and Nicole was very responsive and we will get a refund for that night. Other than that. we loved the place and would go back without hesitation. if this issue is solved.
25716672,Alexander,June,2020,The location is perfect and the pool is perfect.
25716672,Josh,March,2020,Nicole and Heather's place is incredible. We loved every second of our stay there and would happily recommend it to others. The house is within walking distance to the beach. We look forward to visiting Puerto Rico again!
25716672,Scott,March,2020,Great place . great location . Nicole and Heather are easy to deal with . We hope to return sooner than later
25716672,Kelsey,February,2020,We had a lovely stay at the Amapola house with a group of 5 adults. Clean. spacious and full of thoughtful amenities (pool toys. cards. etc). We were high enough on the hill to catch the ocean breeze but close enough to the hot night spots (tamboo. pool bar. sandy beach etc) to walk (mind you it is a hill!). Rooftop pool was a great way to start and end the day!
25716672,William,January,2020,The pictures don't do this home justice. the views and location are unbelievable. Within 20 min of all the best surf breaks and ample room for 7 people. We had a blast and hope to be back again!
25716672,William,November,2019,Gorgeous home with amazing views from the rooftop. Nicole & Heather were very responsive with any questions we had during our stay. Would absolutely come back and stay here!
25716672,Jose R,September,2019,The house is very comfortable. great location and amazing views
25716672,Nicole T,August,2019,Loved the house. I had a group of 8 celebrating my 40th bday and we all fit perfectly. Lower suite was great to have some privacy. House was clean. supplied everything we needed. Grill was awesome to have. Two minutes from the beaches. Sunsets on the rooftop. Views on views! Hope to be back real soon. Rinc√≤n is my absolute favorite place to vacation and this house just added to the glory. Thank you for having us!
25716672,Julia,March,2019,Great location. plenty of amenities. washer and dryer was perfect and they provided plenty of towels.  The house was clean and very spacious.
25716672,James,March,2019,Everything was perfect. 10/10. Amazing house and great location. Exactly as advertised. We didn‚Äôt have a single issue or complaint. Owners and property management were very responsive and helpful in giving us clear instructs about accessing the house and any questions that we had. 100% would stay here again and highly recommend it.
25716672,Michael,February,2019,The house is very well kept and clean. We enjoyed our stay. There was one day the area has water restriction and we had one day without water. The driveway is a challenge for parking.
25716672,Brad,February,2019,We had a lovely stay at this comfortable and well stocked house. The location was excellent with a sweeping rooftop view complete with hot tub and tiki bar. The beds were comfy and the place was clean and well cared for. Nicole and Heather were quick to reply and they had a local property manager to make sure we were in good hands the whole trip. We will be back for sure!
25716672,Kellie,February,2019,Amapola House was one of the most incredible Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. From the upper deck. we enjoyed 360¬∞ views of the beautiful island. It was truly a paradise. In the evening we sat on the outdoor upper patio. You could see every star. breathtaking! The location was perfect for us and it was nice to have a large 4 bedroom home for my group. Loved the vist to Rincon and would highly recommend staying at Amapola if you're considering a visit here too. The hosts are very helpful and informative on the area. dining and activities as well. We took advantage of the shopping service and had the refrigerator stocked for our early arrival. It was really lovely to have that option. especially with our late evening flights. Cant say enough great things about this experience!
25716672,Ben,February,2019,The house is in a perfect location. you can even walk down to some fun bars and good food! Short drive to all the beaches. The house was clean. had great AC. some fun games at night. a very cool rooftop and was perfect for our group of 7. Views were incredible. Bathrooms clean. Bonus beach chairs and beach towels were available. Can‚Äôt ask for much more!
25716672,Mackenzie,January,2019,Our group loved Casa Amapola and feel it was a great value! We are repeat visitors and think Puntas is the best part of Rincon. Guests can walk to Sandy Beach. Pools Beach. Tamboo. Pools Bar. Big Kahuna Burger Bar. a convenience store. coffee/smoothie spot. and several other great food/drink spots while staying uphill tucked into nature away from the noise and with great views. If the waves are big. there may not be beach to sit on at Sandy/Pools  but you can drive to other nearby beaches (some of our group did not realize this and were initially disappointed thinking these beaches are not usable to sit & relax). The house itself is beautiful and the neighbors are very nice. Tony. the outdoors caretaker. is a wonderful guy. The kitchen is small but efficient and has what you need to make most meals. We had an inconsequential issue that was easily fixed and when mentioned to the owners they went above and beyond to make it more than up to us. The bedrooms are large with comfy pillows and good AC. We found that some of the bedrooms had much more comfortable mattresses than others and the master bed is squeaky. so if you are picky about that sort of thing try to get first choice. The owners message communication was great and overall we are very happy with the entire experience. Would stay again.Show more
25716672,Heather,January,2019,This is the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in! My husband and I were celebrating our honeymoon with friends and we were all blown away by how nice Amapola House was. The amazing location and view aside. the house itself was impeccably clean and felt so comfortable and professionally maintained. The caretaker. Tonio. next door was very attentive and friendly. even spotting our large SUV out of the driveway in the morning. There were lots of amenities and little touches. like a bouquet of congratulatory flowers for us and much appreciated aloe vera. I would recommend Amapola House to everyone. especially considering the excellent value when staying with a group. It was the highlight of our stay in Rinc√≥n!
25716672,Zayra,January,2019,Beautiful home- we really enjoyed our time there. Hosts have cooking supplies. towels. BBQ and everything needed for a comfortable stay. About a half a mile from the nearest beach (Sandy Beach). The Beautiful upstairs deck was perfect to watch the night sky. There are a lot of stairs...just Something to consider if bringing kids. The private suite and plunge pool are completely separated from the main house with limited access: not a good or bad thing... just something else to take into account depending of what you are looking for. The private suite is very nice and does provide an extra level of privacy if needed when traveling in large groups. Overall we definitely enjoyed our stay.
25716672,Caly,December,2018,We just got back from a wonderful vacation at the Amapola House! The house is¬† beautiful and the views are breathtaking.¬† The 4 bedrooms are very spacious and the roof deck is amazing! The perfect spot for star gazing at night. we even saw a shooting star.¬† It is a quick walk to the beach and to the local restaurants and bars.¬† ¬†I would definitely recommend Amapola House to anyone thinking of visiting Rincon and hope to come back again soon!
25716672,Jessica,September,2018,It was my first time at an Airbnb and I was a bit afraid that the place wasn't as pictured. The pictures posted for the Amapola house don't make it justice. The house is lovely and the view is amazing! The neighborhood is quiet and is close to great restaurants and beaches. Capriccio and Villa Cofresi are great restaurants. The hosts were attentive and thoughtful. I'll definitely stay here when I come back to PR.
25716672,Irving,July,2018,This home is in a great location; on top of a hill overlooking the ocean. However. close enough to the beach that you don‚Äôt feel isolated. The checkin and checkout were easy and we found the home to be very welcoming and cozy. This was my first time to Puerto Rico and I sure fell in love with the area. Thank you :)

2502846,Christine,April,2021,We loved Casa Vista del Mar and extended our stay one night because we missed the sunset from our balcony. The place is SO much better than the Airbnb photos. The Inn is high up on a hill overlooking Rincon and the ocean. Our room was clean. spacious and had a large balcony with chairs to sit. relax and enjoy the sunset. The owner and the staff. especially Lorenzo. was super friendly. helpful. accommodating and most of all. very welcoming. Richard. the owner. was kind enough to call when we had not arrived at the scheduled time that evening and kindly accommodated our late arrival.I would highly recommend you stay at Casa Vista del Mar¬†on your PR holidays.

2502846,Ryan,May,2015,We've stayed here twice.  Both times were great.  It's a little difficult to find the first time. but after that it is great.  It's tough to find because it's at the top of a large hill = great views of the ocean.  The place is very clean. everything works great and a nice kitchen.  I would recommend staying here.
2502846,Bianca,March,2015,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Casa Visa Del Mar! Traveled to the west side of the island for a small getaway with 3 other guests and this was exactly what we had in mind-- we have nothing but great things to say about our experience here. Very clean and welcoming. Our host (Richard) made us feel at home and was very accessible.  If you are looking for a simple. quiet. relaxing getaway with a fabulous view to wake up to.

The home has a minimalist. beach-zen vibe; comfortable for my family of 4.  The kitchen had all the essentials plus extras. Rooms were spacious with comfy beds. The home came fully equipped with all kinds of beach accessories. On the one rainy afternoon we played board games. fun family time. The location is ideal. private and quiet and just a 2 minute drive to beaches & restaraunts.  Amzing place. great memories.
543608331285685640,Victoria,May,2022,The view is just as beautiful in person as it is pictured! We loved spending time on the balcony. The Airbnb had everything we needed and more. Would absolutely stay again!
543608331285685640,,MayraApril,2022,Beautiful place. superrrrr clean.
543608331285685640,Sean,March,2022,I'd definitely stay at this place again - especially when I want a quick escape. The view is just as peaceful as it looks in photos.
543608331285685640,Chris,March,2022,Perfect place to have a Rinc√≥n getaway! Great facilities. location. and communicative hosts.
543608331285685640,Alexandra,February,2022,The house has a breathtaking view and the sound of the ocean was soothing.  House was super clean and simple but nicely decorated.  The area was calm and quiet.  Just what we needed for our escape.

5066216,Janelle,July,2021,OMG the views!!! Pictures does not do this place justice. the views are out of this world and sunsets every night!! Richard and Lorenzo are the best. super helpful and sweet. I was even having trouble finding a mosquito zapper and Lorenzo found one at a store and bought it for me. Love. I'm in a one bedroom and the bed is super comfortable. kitchen and living space have everything you could need. You do need a car when staying here though. its up on a hill so the walk to the beach would be strenuous on the way back. For those wanting to stay long term the wifi is good (a part from the standard island power outages). I've had no issues working remotely. Highly recommend staying here!!
5066216,Mary,May,2021,awesome place!
5066216,Megan,April,2021,The view was amazing and it was great to sit on the balcony and watch the sunset. Lorenzo was the person at the property and was very friendly and helpful! The beds were comfortable however there was no blankets on the bed or in the closet. There was also a breakfast the next morning which we did not expect and was great! I would recommend to management of this property to send check in instructions and an address. It was not communicated with us that there was a time frame to check in and we did not have the address to find the location. Overall it was a great stay and we would stay here again!
5066216,Response from Richard M,July,2019,Thank you
5066216,Justin,January,2017,nice place
5066216,Hans Yngvar,March,2016,Had a very pleasant stay at CasaVistaDelMar! Richard is a warm and social host! Encouraged us to use the grill which resulted in a great BBQ dinner on the terrace. Nice view from the balcony from were we enjoyed a few Medallas and drinks ;) The apartment had what was needed. Will recommend other friends to stay at CVDM in future. Thank you for a great start on our trip to Puerto Rico wich btw was fantastic!  Regards from Hans. Eirik. Ola & Herman

47861301,Eric,May,2022,It was a great place to stay. its location is at the center of the plaza. which is great because beaches and points of interest are close by.

Ignaris is such a great person and also helped me with places to go and what to do around the area.
47861301,Sankalp,April,2022,Nice location and the host is very communicative !  The room is clean but could use a new set of sheet. Also the pool is shared by other rooms as well. The place is very close to the market. restaurants and the beach.

Felt secluded but was only a short walk to Playa Maria and from there you could continue along the shore to Playa Escalera for swimming and snorkeling. The kitchenette was basic but everything worked so we could prepare simple meals. There was a friendly couple in the next apartment so we did hear them through the walls but we didn't mind. Overall great value. would stay again.

We had a bit of trouble finding the place but the hosts called us and gave us directions on how to find the place. The Airbnb was spotless and had all the amenities listed. The host Amelia and Irra even went above and beyond by going out  to buy us a warm blanket for the bed when we asked for one. The Airbnb was amazing. and enhanced my friend‚Äôs and I stay in Puerto Rico.  Amelia and Irra were incredible host that were there if we had any questions and their warm personalities made us feel at home. Highly recommend staying here!!

16218317,Yolanda,May,2017,Amelia was wonderful. we were running late and because it was raining she got worried and call us to make sure we were okay.  The place was immaculate clean. The place has wonderful  views. loved the location. very peaceful!!  We will definitely return!!
16218317,Cody,April,2017,The house and grounds were great. The location was perfect. close to town. but far enough to enjoy some peace and quiet. 3 minute drive to the beach. The host were great and were willing to help with anything we needed. Would recommend to friends who are looking to stay in the area.
16218317,Ian,March,2017,Amelia and Irra were incredibly nice. Our plane landed at 3am and they allowed us to checkin at 5:30 am. The location of the house is great. a walks distance to the beach and a great restaurant/bar named The Beach House. There is much to do in Rincon if you are looking to get less of a tourism feel and experience PR like a local. Many events were being held around us. all of which Amelia was kind enough to tell us about. There were able to be reached at any time. There was milk and apple juice in the fridge. alongside many cleaned plates and silverware. We highly recommend staying at this Airbnb. as the view from the yard and deck is outstanding!
16218317,Response from Amelia And Irra,March,2017,Thanks Dean for your beautiful comments. Was a pleasure be your host because you're a great guest. Hope we can welcome you again. Take care and lots of blessings
16218317,Cedric,February,2017,Amelia. her husband and son are so kind and welcoming. They were always available to answer questions or provided us with needed tools such as an iron. On the morning we discovered a basquet of goodies awaiting us. The location is well situated for easy access to Maria's beach which is a central surfing location where lessons are available. Sandy beach and the downtown plaza are an easy drive away. We didn't take advantage of the view nor the hammock on their deck with a view but that's cause there is so much to see and do in Rincon.Loved everything especially our host. Would stay again in heartbeat.
16218317,Response from Amelia And Irra,February,2017,Thanks David for your beautiful comment. We are very happy that you like our home. You were excellent guests . Wishing to see you again.Best regards.

16218317,Steven,December,2016,It was a pleasant stay. Does have plenty of room. The kitchen had not pots so there is a place to cook just nothing to cook in. There is another apartment attached so it may not be the most private of choices but still nice. If you choose to stay be aware that you'll need a car to get around but everything is a pretty short drive away. The host were very kind and attentive. Their property is beautiful.
16218317,Response from Amelia And Irra,June,2021,Thank you Sara for your good feedback. Our location  is something everyone praises..But  if you need a car  to move around  better. This is explained  in the description.  Take care of yourselves. and  many blessings.Translated¬†¬†Show original

2422782,William,October,2022,Home was mostly as it was advertised. Great location. spacious and fit all of our needs. Only issues were with the hot water in the showers and some broken furniture in the living room (coffee table was snapped in half but was just moved off to the side of the room) and roof deck (many of the cabinet doors in the little kitchen area were snapped off the hinges and just laying on the counter). These did not really take away from our stay as we were mostly out and about on the town and at the beach. I'd stay here again for the price
2422782,Jazmin,September,2022,Everything you need for a perfect vacation. We loved it
2422782,Edith,August,2022,Clean and nice place to stay. near center of town and within walking distance to the beach.
2422782,Jackie,August,2022,Jennifer is a great host.  This place was perfect for family vacation. Very clean and spacious. Good location.
2422782,Naomi,August,2022,Loved it here. clean. spacious fancy and thePool was great! Laundry room was a bonus and the ac units !!
2422782,Manny,August,2022,Excellent quiet ubication. the beach is just around the property you'll find the trail just outside the gate to the right. though ill recommend more Sandy beach that still walking distant but in car is just like a 3 to 4 minute ride.  Rooms comfortable. clean and plenty of bathrooms for a big family.  Puerto Rico have a big power problem and in this property you won't notice at all if the power went out or on and for us was a BIG PLUS.  Washer and Dryer another big plus since you'll be from the pool to the beach you'll never run out of dry towels... Kitchen full equipped just bring the ingredients and cook.
2422782,Spencer,July,2022,It was everything it was advertised to be. We loved it. We hope to stay there again.
2422782,Roberto,July,2022,Jennifer sent the instructions with plenty time in advance in a text message. that's helped a lot because my phone have not signal at the place. Place was clean. nice wifi internet. gated community with automatic power generator. that's a plus.
2422782,DValle,June,2022,Laly was a super host! Responded very quickly. and was very accommodating to our needs/requests. Check-in instructions were super detailed and helpful.  The house was clean. big and well stocked (beach chairs). The washer and dryer was very convenient since the beach it's just a short walk. Great food and entertainment very close. I was able to work well since the wifi signa is very strong and reliable. We could not have asked for a better location. Overall a wonderful place; we would stay here again easily!
2422782,Tom,April,2022,Landing View is perfectly located with great accommodations.  Fully equipped kitchen. washer/dryer. beach chairs. Awesome. It‚Äôs a short walk to the beach.. 3 minutes.  At times.  it felt like we were the only ones there‚Ä¶ My wife loved the beach and would pick up sea glass for hours everyday.  (For surfers) A rental car is a must to bounce around to the different surf breaks.  Better surf in the mornings here before the wind shifts.  My only constructive suggestion is a propane grill instead of charcoal.  This place is a 10/10!

2422782,Harmony,January,2022,We love this condo complex (our 4th time staying but first time in this unit). Our 2 kids love the little pool and we grownups love the 2 minute walk to striking beaches and 5 minute walk to Barefoot Yoga on the beach. The condo itself is spacious with a lovely 3rd floor deck with a roof. The kitchen is equipped with the basics and the bed mattresses are nice and firm. TV works with Netflix (if that‚Äôs your thing) and you can hear the ocean from the bedrooms at night if you turn off the AC and open the screened in windows. The furnishings are a bit sparse but what is there is comfortable and works well. We appreciated that they had beach towels and chairs and pool noodles to borrow.
2422782,Cara,November,2021,Great location at Sandy Beach in Rincon - walking distance to a nice beach. restaurants. shops. etc. This is small townhome complex with a pool. entry gate. so it was quiet. This unit in particular needs some things. but overall. the price was reasonable compared to most other rentals that were available over the holiday. We did have good communication from the property manager during our stay and they helped with the few things we needed. Our family liked the area and would rent a unit in here again.
2422782,Mariandreina,September,2021,The place is big and comfortable. However it was not properly cleaned. There were spiderwebs in some places and the kitchen utenlis were not entirely clean. Also. a lot of humidity which I think caused that the bedsheets had a foul odor. Some walls had filtration I think because the paint of the wall was falling off. I think that for the price this place should be a little more taken care of/updated. A really good thing was that even though the place was out of electricity in two occasions. the condo has an electric generator and we were never without electricity! A/C. Oven and TV worked very good and many towels were given for the beach and the house.

2422782,Luke,February,2021,Loved the spot. Apple Maps sent me the back way. so be weary when arriving that you might be in the back. The spot is amazing. Me and 7 friends went down for a surfing trip. The neighbors are great and fun but not intruding. There‚Äôs a great restaurant walking distance from the condo. A great little quiet beach right outside the gates. Will definitely come back to this spot!
2422782,Gracie,February,2021,Such a great location! Walking distance to sandy beach and the restaurants & bars. The space was just as described. and the rooftop was such a wonderful place to spend time. The Charcoal grill was a bonus to be able to cook at home. Parking was easy. and being in a gated area added to the privacy of the home. We would for sure stay here again In the future!
2422782,Response from Jennifer,February,2021,Thank you! :)
2422782,Response from Jennifer,January,2021,Thanks!:)
2422782,Matteo,December,2020,A beautiful location. very spacious and nice terrace house. Managers were kind to respond quickly and address  our feedback on some missing items. The house has a great balcony and good common spaces. convenient parking. privacy and some nice views of the  trees dividing the place from the beach. even a glimpse of the ocean behind them.
2422782,Pierre Antoine,November,2020,Very good apartment. Very nice despite missing a table big enough for 8 people or even 6. Some kitchen tools are missing (oven plates. plates).Protected property with closed gate and private parking which is really nice.I would definitely recommend it.
2422782,Victor,November,2020,The place is amazing. great location...
2422782,Michael,November,2020,Great place. Great quite location
2422782,Response from Jennifer,October,2020,Jeanette.   Sorry for the inconvenience during your stay. Unfortunately. we don't have any calls or emails from you notifying about this situation. We are always available to assist you if you need us during your stay at the property.Show more

2422782,Response from Jennifer,April,2020,:D
2422782,Rebecca,February,2020,We spent 3 nights at Landing View. It was in a gorgeous location. steps from Sandy beach and close to restaurants and shops. It was quiet and peaceful. The pool was clean and inviting. Jennifer was a responsive host and worked with us when we had to reschedule our stay. The unit was spacious. but in dire need of a deep cleaning. The den furniture needs to be replaced and the kitchen was not well equipped. The appliances were old and dirty. The dishes. pots. and pans all need to be replaced. With some TLC. this place has the potential to be amazing.
2422782,Devin,February,2020,Perfect location to surf the beach break and have a bonfire. It was a little ‚Äúrustic‚Äù as far as missing lightbulbs and such but a great pad for a group!
2422782,Response from Jennifer,December,2019,Thank you Armando.

2422782,Terrence,April,2019,The host was great!  The place was amazing!  The other residents were nice!  It was also very quiet and peaceful.  No complaints and I would  book again.
2422782,Response from Jennifer,March,2019,Brian. we are sorry for the inconvenience of your trip. We agreed to early check-in at no cost to you guys and you did not even have to wait 10 minutes for the keys so I believe this comment from your part is unfair. The a/c has already been fixed and the light bulbs replaced. The pool and gate. unfortunately.  are handled by an administration company hired by the HOA (which will be replaced on April 1). The cleaning ladies said there were 8 towels left and when you guys check out there were still 8 towels. not sure if you guys did not saw them on the closets or whar. Either way I am glad you enjoyed Rincon.Show more
2422782,Michael,March,2019,Great location. rooftop area is awesome.
2422782,Garret,February,2019,Amazing place and so close to the beach!  A must stay!
2422782,Normarys,January,2019,Very cool place to stay that easily accommodates 8 people (combination of adults and children would be more comfortable). It‚Äôs located right next to Sandy Beach in Rincon which is not one of the best for swimming but great to hang out with lots of shade. The apt complex has a small pool great for kids.
2422782,Response from Jennifer,December,2018,Thanks !  We are always at your service.
2422782,Maria,August,2018,Our vacation at Landing View. Rincon Surf Villa was awesome! Jennifer and associates were most hospitable and accommodating. The place was spacious. clean. elegant and minutes away from downtown Rincon. We especially enjoyed the terrace view to the beach and landscape. The neighborhood was peaceful and felt safe. We were also lucky to have the complex with its own generator while parts of the surrounding area suffered a long blackout. We were very pleased with this accommodation and have already referred this place to friends and family in Puerto Rico and the US.
2422782,Jc,July,2018,Great spot. clean and comfortable.
2422782,Maria,July,2018,You need to book here. it‚Äôs great! The house. the views. the night life. the restaurants. and of corse the beach it was awsome!
2422782,Response from Jennifer,July,2018,"As soon as someone books any of the properties I manage they get a message from me with our two phone numbers and the message is signed at the bottom as Jennifer from Tropical Coast Properties. The welcome message states that I am NOT always available but that someone from my team will always reply our phone or messages.  We allowed Lourdes an early check in and late check out at no extra cost. giving her over 10 hours free. When she called at 10 pm Friday night Milton explained to her that a technician will go next day and that Jennifer was not in at that moment.  The Airbnb message Lourdes sent at 10 pm was ""Please call me"". To which we saw but as she followed the message immediately with a phone call and we spoke on the phone with her. we did not reply the Airbnb message. When the technician went the following morning he found the ac working and stated the issue was that the whole area had low voltage the night before which is 100% out of our hands.  Because of the inconvenience as stated before.  a late check out was given. This whole bad review its pointless. but we can't make everyone happy unfortunately.  Place was clean. all amenities working. phone was answered all the time. early check in.  late check out...  Besides. nowhere in the amenities we offer washer and dryer so mentioning something as an inconvenience  that was not offered does not even makes sense.Show more"
2422782,Wilfredo,March,2018,This is an excellent villa to stay with your family and/or friends. It is walking distance to Sandy Beach and you can even hear the waves at night from the villa. The host Jennifer was always available and answered all of our questions in a promptly maner. We had a great time.  The check in and check out process was stress free!!!
2422782,Maria,August,2017,The apartment was excellent! Just as described in the photos. It is comfortable for big groups. The apartment is in a quiet complex. easy to reach. and close to the beach. Definitely would stay again and for a longer time!
2422782,Enrique,July,2017,Place was as described and quite wonderful. The host was most accommodating. and we would stay there again next time we have the chance to.

2422782,Nadia,January,2017,The communication was excellent. we txt and received answers very quick. The property is in the end of Tamboo street. very well located near Sandy Beach. The property has 3 levels. downstairs the 3 rooms. comfortable beds and 2 full baths. 1 in master and 1 for the other 2. The master fit 2. but the other 2 rooms fits for 3 people each. On the upper level. the kitchen. half bath. balcony living and dining very spacious and open space. There's a sofa bed. but we didn't use it. On the second level there's a beautiful terrace with a half bath. We really liked the property. very comfortable for 6. which we were. Very clean. organized and everything worked very well. The 2 parkings are in front of the townhouse. Definitely staying again.
2422782,Kelsey,January,2017,We really enjoyed staying here! The place is pretty basic. but is as promised. It was clean and ready to go when we arrived. and the location close to the beach can't be beat! We would stay here again!

53555166,Deborah,December,2022,This beautiful home was just as described. Location was everything. Easy access to the beach. food and shopping.
53555166,Dawn,November,2022,We had an absolutely amazing stay! Victor was very attentive and quick to answer any questions we had and gave incredible local recommendations. The home is walking distance to downtown rincon. the grocery store. a fruit market. food trucks. a near private beach. and only a few minutes drive to the local attractions. Couldn't be more perfect.
53555166,Ari,September,2022,Naomi‚Äôs place is absolutely gorgeous! The place had everything we needed and extras! The host was extremely attentive and helpful!! We would definitely go back!!
53555166,Alyssa,August,2022,Victor was super responsive! We had a great time!
53555166,Adam,July,2022,The house was great! My family really enjoyed our vacation. Everything you need is in driving distance.
53555166,Andrea,July,2022,Loved the airbnb! Accurate with the pictures and description. great location and spacious! Would stay again
53555166,Glenda,July,2022,Super comfortable house for our group of 10. Great location too! We did enjoy our stay very much.
53555166,David,July,2022,Casa Naniki was an absolute wonderful place to stay. The house was beautiful. clean. spacious and fully equipped with anything you may need! The location is convenient to restaurants. shops. and the beach. Victor is amazing and responsive when taking care of our needs! We highly recommend Casa Naniki and look forward to staying there again!!
53555166,David,June,2022,Great place to stay!
53555166,Justin,June,2022,Casa Naniki is an amazing place to make unforgettable memories.  The house is stocked with everything you need away from home.  We had 13 people with us and we all fit great and had plenty of room.  The house is in an amazing location . Just head down the street and go left to get to food trucks and the food plaza (open Thursday-Sunday) that has delicious Puertorican and American options.  There is a fruit stand by the food trucks that we went to almost everyday  and a little further down the street a really good Acai bowl place my daughter loved.  If you go down street from the house and head right you have a convenience store. the bakery (amazing breakfast burritos) and  the grocery store . Go past the grocery store for a 5 min walk and the beautiful local beach is right there. which we found was the best beach during our trip so after about a week we stopped looking for another beach and just went there. There are local stores. beach bars and a little Ceasars right by the beach which made it really nice to just walk and grab lunch. We walked to the beach all the time.  it's a short beautiful walk and we always saw some cool iguanas along the way . Casa Naniki is in the perfect location if you want to chill and have a beach vacation or if you want to go out and explore. You are quite a ways away from San Juan and some of Puerto Rico's attractions like the rainforest.  Old San Juan. and Bioluminescent bay but we still did all those and it was fine.  We just picked a couple of days to make the drive and then spent the rest of the time exploring Rincon and the west side of the island.  Rincon is an amazing town with low key charm and all the amenities you need. All in all we loved the location of Casa Naniki and working with Victor was easy and helpful.  Anytime we had questions he answered promptly and was a big help.  This place is amazing and we will always remember the great memories made there.Show more
53555166,Jacinth,May,2022,Naomi is a great host and the place is amazing. Spacious and very clean. Love the interior design.
53555166,Constance,May,2022,Everything was great. Clean & had everything you could possibly need. The only thing I would note is that the downstairs rooms are separate and not connected. so if you have younger children it‚Äôs not ideal. Also. if you‚Äôre a light sleeper like me. bring earplugs as there is a peacock farm down the street and you could hear them at night.
53555166,Astrid,May,2022,Beautiful and big house
53555166,Robert,May,2022,1
53555166,Frances,April,2022,Perfect place to stay with family and friends!! Near everything you need and walking distance! The house was perfect! Super clean! Every detail it has made it more comfortable and welcoming. Will return in a future!
53555166,Amy,March,2022,Such a great house for groups of all sizes. Casa Naniki has everything you need for a great trip. beach gear. games. towels. surf boards. Super cute rooms. comfy beds and great A/C. We love the manager Victor!
53555166,Erin,March,2022,One of the BEST AirBnB experiences we have ever had! Clean house. comfy beds and hammocks. and creative use of space inside and outside the house. Perfect for a large family (or multiple families). The kids had a blast in the pool and game room. my husband and I were relaxed and loved the location. and the communication was excellent. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. We will visit Casa Naniki again!
53555166,Jillian,March,2022,The house was gorgeous and Victor was very responsive. Perfect distance to the beach and town. Definitely recommend!
53555166,Brian,February,2022,The house was great. Its perfect for a large group or two families.   Everything is updated and clean.     Location is a short drive to everything on the west coast.The neighbors peacocks coming to say hi was an added bonus.  Victor was super easy to communicate with and was very accommodating.
53555166,Peter,February,2022,Naomi‚Äôs house is AMAZING! One of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. They have everything you need and a HUGE space to relax in. Wonderful!
53555166,Carolyn,January,2022,Victor was fantastic! Responsive when we needed him with questions and small fixes. The layout of the house with 2 master suites. dining areas in 3 places. the outdoor spaces were wonderful. the kitchen was well stocked for feeding our large family. So convenient to grocery shopping. bakeries. food trucks. fresh vegetables and fruit stands. Rincon in- town shopping. calm beach at Los Almendros and great surfing ( boards included at the house) within 7 minutes of the house. Neighbors very friendly. including the peacocks! and rooster. Weather is perfect everyday. All round a great place to spend 2 weeks!
53555166,Josu√©,January,2022,Wonderful experience! The property is extremely comfortable and the location can‚Äôt be better!  Highly recommended for families or groups of about 10 people! I hope to come back soon!
53555166,Kimberly,December,2021,This was a great place to stay. Luxurious and comfortable. The host was gracious. friendly and responsive. Just a short walk to the beach and downtown. Very relaxing and enjoyable.

The neighborhood is very conveniently located. Would absolutely recommend to stay there! A good bed and nice bathroom. Victor is a great host and there when you need him. Very nice and wants to share all h√© know about the area. We had a great stay!

3869203,Charles,December,2021,Perfect spot near awesome beaches. Glori was helpful and responsive would stay again.
3869203,Victoria,October,2021,Stayed for over a month and this is a great option for a longer stay. It's a light airy space and the backyard is so peaceful. The kitchen has everything. there's plenty of beach towels + chairs and even cleaning supplies. The wifi in Rincon may not be high speed. but it was enough for both of us to take video calls (may just need to go camera off at times).  Glori is also an extremely responsive host who helped us with any questions.
3869203,Amy,September,2021,Glori‚Äôs place was perfect for our stay. Very quite and homie. She was very helpful and accommodating when our flights were cancelled and had to stay an extra night. Will be staying here again!
3869203,Nihal,April,2021,Perfect location with a beautiful view. The town is going through a major transition. and there was construction nearby at the time of our stay. However. we found value in being walking distance to the beach and coffee stands. Glori was a incredible at communicating quickly whenever I had a question or concern. We appreciated our stay. and hopefully the construction will be completed soon.
3869203,Tom,February,2021,Glori‚Äôs place is amazing. The photos don‚Äôt do it justice. The view is amazing and the location is central to everything yet on a quiet tucked away street. The house has everything you need. and the private fenced in yard is a bonus. Less than 10 min walk to the beach. Glori was extremely quick to respond to any questions I had. There were some unusual power issues and surges in the neighborhood that affected some the appliances (out of her control) and Glori had someone out to immediately resolve the issue. She is a very thoughtful and responsive host who went above and beyond. I will be staying here again and highly recommend her place!
3869203,Timmy,January,2021,Glori is one of the most amazing Airbnb hosts I have had in my various travels.

3869203,Mike,March,2020,My wife and I had a great stay at Glori‚Äôs place. The location is central to both the Sandy Beach area and Maria‚Äôs area.

3869203,Adriana,April,2019,From the moment we arrived at the property we were in love! This was a very quiet part of Puntas which was lovely.

You can walk to the beach in 10 minutes. It‚Äôs a bit of a hike up the hill back to the House. but it‚Äôs a gorgeous walk and great way to start the day. We walked to the beach and went for a swim every morning. It‚Äôs best to have water shoes/aqua shoes to go in the water here as the bottom is rocky. But we didn‚Äôt have any and we were able to swim fine without them. Just look for the place on the beach where there are no rocks and just sand. then start to swim there. The kitchen is set up well the bathroom and bedrooms are set up well and everything works as advertised. There are several restaurants nearby you can walk or drive to in minutes. We liked Tamboo.  We opted to mostly cook during the day and go out to eat at night. The large local grocery stores have all kinds of fresh healthy food. So we could eat healthy while there. The Internet can be a bit slow but it‚Äôs as fast as anywhere in Rincon.  We quickly adjusted to using that. you can play YouTube videos etc. with occasional delays. One last thing to note is the fresh air.  You will feel amazingly refreshed and healthy after staying here.  We already thinking about when we can go back!! Highly recommended.  Thanks Again Gloria!!Show more
3869203,Teresa,February,2018,We loved Glori‚Äôs home.  Great location. beautiful view. nicely decorated.   We can‚Äôt wait to return.
3869203,Ellen,January,2018,We loved this house! The yard was perfect for our 2 small children. The house was a perfect blend of simplicity and functional. Our family of 4 was very comfortable here. It was quiet and the view of the ocean rewarding.
3869203,Evan,January,2018,I stayed at Glori's place for about a week. The house is perfect. the view is breathtaking and Glori was so responsive and a pleasure to deal with.  I should also note that I stayed after Hurricane Maria. and the house has weathered the storm very well.  Go to PR and stay at Glori's!
3869203,Joe,June,2017,Staying at Glori's place was a total joy! The house is as described. I enjoyed the house. the yard and the view! The location is excellent. I was able to get in and around Rincon without any issues. I also spent time at the home and was able to cook a few meals. The overall experience is 5 stars!
3869203,Jen,May,2017,Glori was a great host. Very accommodating. easy going about check out. Nice home with quality pots and pans and dishes. which isn't easy to find. I really appreciated it.
3869203,Lauren,April,2017,Love this place! It's the second time I've stayed here when coming to Rincon -- great location in chill Puntas. great backyard area. clean. and great location.
3869203,Natalie,March,2017,This was our third year to stay here and it is always wonderful!
3869203,Christopher,February,2017,Great communication with host. House is really clean and nice. Super quiet neighborhood with great long distance view of the ocean from the backyard. I would stay here again if I was in the area.
3869203,Meghan,February,2017,Loved Glori's place and she was very quick to respond by email/text. We lost power for 1.5 days (which is expected in Rincon) due to a transformer blowing- so do not be surprised if it happens during your stay. But it wasn't a problem- we opened the windows and had a nice breeze off of the ocean. The house was perfect for my husband and I and was very close and convenient to local surfing spots (Sandy Beach and Maria's) with great local restaraunts. We loved Pool Bar Sushi and La Cambija. We also ate at a lot of local food trucks and coffee spots. We will definitely be back! The neighborhood was very quiet with a beautiful view. Thanks!
3869203,Joy,December,2016,Nice location.  Very nice weather at the house due to wind coming from the ocean... this is a highlight!!!  Very clean and organize... It looks better than in the pictures.
3869203,Mariela,July,2016,We truly appreciate Glori's availability to help with directions and for answering all of our questions in no time. Our stay was truly enjoyable and I would highly recommend this little piece of heaven on earth to anyone who is looking for a get-away.
3869203,Natalie,March,2016,This is our second time staying at Glori's house and it once again was a wonderful place to stay for a week for my family of four. Glori is a great host and always there when you need her. The house is very nice packed with all essentials you need and the view of the ocean is beautiful. It is located in quiet area but still within walking distance to the beach. restaurants. and shops. We will back next year and hope to stay there a third time.
3869203,Keith And Shannon,March,2016,Cozy little house on the hill a short walk down to the beach.  Glori  was great. quick to respond to the few questions I had.  The house has a good view and nice grassy yard.  Really just one neighbor. who was very friendly.  The house is well appointed and comfortable.
3869203,Response from Glori,February,2016,Thank you. Marisa! Would love to have you back again :)
3869203,Brett,February,2016,The house was great! It's in walking distance to the beach and it's quite at night. There is a great view of the ocean from the back yard as well. The house was  clean and very well furnished. The owner did a great job communicating with us as well!
3869203,Emelia,January,2016,We have spent two weeks in Gloris wonderful house and it has been perfect for our wishes and needs! Airy and clean house with a very well equipped kitchen. comfortable beds. good wifi. close to our favourite surf rental and yoga place Barefoot yoga. safe and friendly area. We have been to Puerto Rico and have rented houses and apartments several times on the island before and this is in our opinion definitely one of the best rentals so far.
3869203,Lindsay,January,2016,I just got back from a girls trip to Rincon with three of my bests and I cannot say enough good things about Glori's home. It was the perfect spot! The house was clean and stocked with all the essentials for a day at the beach. The yard was spacious with an incredible view! It was a great spot for our evening hangouts. The location made it easy to get around to all the beaches and restaurants. Glori herself was a pleasure to work with and was always available to answer any questions we had! I highly recommend this place for your next trip to PR!!
3869203,Response from Glori,January,2016,Great to know you enjoyed your stay. would love to have you back at my house!
3869203,Jan,December,2015,Glori was a great host and she was always available to answer all our questions. The house was nicer than the pictures and it worked great for our family with a small kid. We stayed in a hotel in Rincon last year and staying at Glori's was a lot more convenient and enjoyable. The house had everything that we needed. Our son played with his trucks in the garden in the morning and we spent afternoons on the beach. I walked down the hill to Sandy's beach every morning to surf or drove to Maria's.
3869203,Lauren,April,2015,We were three women coming to Rincon to surf for a long weekend and we loved our stay at Glori's home. It's the perfect location in Puntas - in my opinion the best area of Rincon and was a short 1 minute drive to Rincon Surf School. as well as a board rental shop. which was perfect for us because we did a guided surf. The space was clean and looks much better in person than photos. Spacious backyard. and private undeveloped location. Would definitely stay here again.
3869203,Response from Glori,February,2015,Thanks Matt. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay. and construction's supposed to be over in a week. so hopefully next time you'll only hear the birds and the surf breaking!
3869203,Mary Anne,December,2014,"We had a great stay at Glori's home in Rincon over Christmas.  We have been to Rincon before so we were looking for our own place with ocean views. quiet nights and easy parking.  Glori's brand new beach house was just right.  Although we drive quite a bit to check out different beaches and restaurants. our favorite place to eat are in Puntas so we like this location.  The house is close to Pool Bar. Kabanas and Lazy Parrot and just a bit further is La Cambija and Good Eats.  I recommend that you try all of these.  With a full kitchen. we could cook and snack ""at home"" as well.    The wifi is excellent.  There are beach chairs. beach towels. a nice cooler and surfboard storage.  Sometimes it was hard to get going in the morning as the view was great and the home was very comfortable.  This home is on a side street so there is more privacy and quiet than many of the homes in Puntas.  Even though we could have walked down the hill to the beach at Casa Islena. we were most often at Maria's or the marina and were glad to return to our peaceful retreat at the end of the day.  This is a great spot for a Rincon vacation.Show moreResponse from GloriJanuary 2015Thank you so much. Mary Anne. it's great to know you enjoyed your time here. I hope next time you're here you can enjoy papayas. lemons and maybe bananas and plantains from the patio!"

3869203,Sandra,February,2020,We had a pleasant long stay at Glori's.Availability when needed. And especially the quality of the amenities and the exceptional view!!! In addition. proximity to all amenities and the beach!What happiness!We recommend you. especially with children. the fairly large garden is a plus!Translated from French¬†¬†Show original
3869203,Response from Glori,August,2019,It would be a waste of my time to respond to all these lies. From the moment I arrived. I realized her strategy to lie to Airbnb about a refund. She dirty the beds with sand and then claimed. She's a scammer. The other reviews on my property speak for themselves.Show moreTranslated¬†¬†Show original
3869203,Judy,July,2019,A cozy house with high ceilings that will not go unnoticed because. in addition to being very colorful.  they allow excellent ventilation. The backyard has a beautiful ocean view that you will surely see on more than one occasion. The house has everything you might need: equipped kitchen. board games (we prefer dominoes and Uno). outdoor chairs. comfortable sofa. beach towels. outdoor shower to remove sand when you arrive from the beach.  rooms with good air. among others. The most we enjoyed was our breakfasts and dinners overlooking the ocean.  Although we did not arrive in time to meet Glori. her instructions and prompt responses to our messages. from before arriving. helped us a lot and gave us a lot of confidence. We were very comfortable at all times. For those who prefer walks. Playa Antonio and Sandy Beach are nearby. Thank you Glori. we loved your house and it allowed us to spend a very pleasant few days.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

45909669,Response from Jennifer,December,2021,Thanks!!!
45909669,Response from Jennifer,August,2021,Danielle started calling us at 5 am to request a refund when our office opens at 8 am. When we called her her husband was screaming at us over the phone. Airbnb does not oblige us as hosts to provide a refund for canceled flights. however. we understand it was not their fault and provided a full refund. It is unbelievable that we were fair to them and they provide this review.Show more
45909669,Response from Jennifer,August,2021,Lucas. it was great having you. Our listings are self-catered rentals so guests must be extra toiletries. Rincon is a small town but we always recommend renting a car to move around. Also. the beach changes depending on the weather. This week has been flat!Show more
45909669,Amado,July,2021,Location is a bit hard to find...the google drop pin is not accurate. Entering the complex there is a HUGE INCLINE driveway that almost goes straight up. If you have a car load of people. it will be a bit of a struggle to make it up the hill. Condo is not new but was clean. furnishings are very basic. AC in all rooms worked very well. which is a MUST in PR. Master Bedroom has french doors that lead onto balcony. which has a nice view of the valley below and to the left you have a great view of the ocean.There were no curtains on the french doors. which was not really a problem UNTIL the first morning when the sun came up full blaze right into the bed and into our eyes. The door faces EAST so there was nothing to block the strong sunlight early in the morning. It was very disappointing and I sent a message to the host. Within two days. they sent someone to install new curtains on the french doors and windows. Although this should have been addressed long ago. we were happy that the owners responded as quickly as they did. Be aware that electricity service can be sketchy in PR. especially where the condo is located. since it is a rural area. Our power went out twice while we were there that lasted 4-5 hours each time. I know that is not the host/owner's fault. but be prepared as that can happen at anytime. There was no remote for the main TV in the living area for two days. but after we mentioned it to the host. it showed up. Wifi worked ok. but is not super fast. Only programming on TV is via smart TV/streaming apps. none of the main channels we usually see. Overall. our stay was ok. but considering the amount we paid for 9 nights I am not sure it was worth it. However. being summertime and peak vacation time. there weren't too many other options for 5 ppl since many of the other places were already booked. Depending on how long you might stay. it is good for 3-4 nights.  Jennifer was responsive and we appreciated that.Show more
45909669,Stacie,July,2021,Great home! Close to beach and a few restaurants.Great views from the room.
45909669,Dailyn,July,2021,Jennifer‚Äôs place was very beautiful and relaxing the first night of my stay. I was there 4 nights and only had power and hot water 2 of the days I was there . It was my birthday trip so I was very upset. Mind you. if the power is out then that means no wifi and if you don‚Äôt have a strong cellular Carrier then that means no phone service until the power is back on and wifi is running. Wifi is also slow. Another bad thing about the power is that I was unable to sleep comfortably due to it being soooo hot in the house . Other then that everything else is pretty cool. I still enjoyed myself . There are local bars & restaurants walking distance. also the beach. I‚Äôd suggest getting a rental car because it‚Äôs almost impossible to get a ride anywhere.

45909669,Maria,June,2021,Place nice and simple. but there is a huge  incline in order to get up to the unit.  Our minivan front end scraped each and every time going up and down.  Pool was green so we didn‚Äôt use it.  On our last night. the town had a blackout so no electricity for a  hours so we left and went to another town.  Balcony big and had outdoor furniture.  Cellular service little to none available.
45909669,Rose,June,2021,Ample space. great views. Pool was not cleaned well. Very hard to find the first time.

45909669,Samantha,April,2021,Jennifer‚Äôs place has one of the best views in Rincon! It‚Äôs so close to the beach. The Airbnb was clean and in a great location. The area is very safe and the condo is locked and gated. The pool was amazing with a view of the ocean. The hill to get to the Airbnb is very steep though and tends to scrape bumpers on regular cars low to the ground. On our first night. the kitchen light was burned out. Jennifer sent someone in the next morning to fix it. Also. the master bedroom is beautiful. but does not have curtains. The sun is beautiful in the morning. but will wake you up early. 6:30 in the morning. This also does not leave much privacy if other guests are out on the balcony. Overall. the stay was amazing! Just those small details would make the stay even more enjoyable. I would recommend Jennifer‚Äôs place to anyone traveling to Rincon!
45909669,Robert,April,2021,Great spot and views. clean. Definitely will be back

In the case of the washer and dryer. it is an isolated one since I did not expect that upon arrival to the property the equipment would have been damaged.  We're working on corrective actions to purchase a new one. There is always an opportunity to improve and it is positive to have feedback from our customers for these purposes. This is the first time the house has been put into service. it is a new purchase in our staff.  With your help you give us the opportunity to improve the experience for our guests.

9993897,Becky,March,2017,"Sara was great.  She was super accommodating and hospitable.  She set up our check in so everything went smoothly.  She provided suggestions for restaurants and day trips to scenic locations.  We had an issue with the hot water heater not working. but she fixed it immediately.  The room was clean and comfortable.  There was laundry on site which was convenient.  My husband and I felt like we were in a secluded. romantic room even though we were staying in a ""hotel"" with many other guests."
9993897,Dana,February,2017,Serenity was beautiful. Its a little off the beaten track but once you get there the area is easy to figure out ! we loved it! it has a stocked kitchen if you wanted to bring your own food to cook. and it also has a very nice hot tub. perfect for winding down at night. Sandy beach is a five minute walk and is a nice place to sit and enjoy a coffee. There is no elevator so just beware if your luggage is heavy you will need to take it up yourself. otherwise it was wonderful ! I would stay here again for sure !
9993897,Sally,February,2017,The room was really nice and clean with a modern feel to it. There was a mini fridge and small coffee pot in the room. which came in handy. And there's plenty of parking available. The walls are thin and we could easily hear people in the halls and in the room next to us (listening to music and talking). but no one was particularly loud. The location was nice. and you definitely need a car. There are some beaches just down the hill that you could walk to. but the main town of Rincon is probably a 5 - 10 minute drive away. Everyone was welcoming and helpful. I'd stay here again.
9993897,William,February,2017,Great location & comfortable rooms
9993897,Ayelet,January,2017,We are so happy we found Serenity. We knew we wanted to stay by Sandy Beach but we wanted something quiet and affordable. Serenity is exactly that. It is walking distance to night life and some great restaurants (Tamboo. Pools Sushi. Casa Verde bar and restaurant) but quiet enough that you can enjoy a peaceful sleep. It is right up the hill from Jakes Java. which is a great place to stop on your way to the beach for a coffee or a smoothie. The room was big and very comfortable. And the service is great! Even though room service isn't included (you pay extra for this if you opt to have your room cleaned). they do change your room towels and beach towels every day. They also provide extra shampoo/conditioner if you ask. We can't thank Sara and her staff enough for being so amazing. My husband had an accident with a sea urchin and Sara made sure we got to the ER. She had us follow her by car and even went into the ER with us to make sure we were taken care of. She went above and beyond!!! We will definitely be returning.
9993897,Kate,December,2016,This place was GREAT. Highly recommend.
9993897,Adrian,December,2016,Hands down one of the best Airbnb we've ever had the pleasure of staying in. Not only was the view and room phenomenal but the staff for sure made this a five star experience. It was located close to the beach and walking distance to all the amazing restaurants we wanted to try. The perfect experience for Rincon.
9993897,Adele,July,2016,Everything was ready and in best conditions at our arrival.
9993897,Giselle,May,2016,My boyfriend and I really love our stay at Serenity. Sara was great host.  Everything was perfect. Highly recommended!!!
9993897,Andrea,May,2016,We loved the experience at Serenity. the place was super clean. quiet and cozy. It was near the beach and places to eat. I definitely  recommend this place.
9993897,Kat,May,2016,After a very active trip all over Puerto Rico. serenity was exactly what we needed: a beautiful place with the most comfortable room of our entire trip! We even had a hard time deciding whether or not to stay the entire day in the hotel instead of going out. This place is amazing. clean and quiet. Sara was so helpful; she is a living encyclopedia of what to do in Puerto Rico. We highly highly recommend this place!
9993897,Brooke,May,2016,Our stay at Serenity was by far the highlight of our trip. Our room was spacious. comfortable. and beautiful. Even though we weren't fortunate enough to have a room with an ocean view (which we weren't expecting). the gorgeous view from our (free!) light breakfast more than made up for it.   If a lovely room and facilities or delightful hospitality doesn't sell you on this place. than its location will. The beach is a short walk away along with several delicious restaurants. bars. and a few other local establishments worth exploring. Still unconvinced? Two words: hot tub.  The only drawbacks were we only stayed two nights. We can't wait to come back!
9993897,Juan Carlos,May,2016,We loved the place that much that we stayed for another night. Two thumbs up
9993897,Ricardo,April,2016,My girlfriend and I celebrated our 9th year anniversary and we had an excellent time. The room was very comfortable. clean. cozy. and had all the necessities we needed for a weekend getaway from the metropolitan area. To be completely honest. this place went beyond our expectations. The room felt bigger than what we saw in the photo and the bed was very comfortable. The location was great (walking distance to Sandy Beach) and plenty of parking. It was very quiet and relaxing to be around the lobby area and even outside on the porch. Sara was a tremendous host and very welcoming from the very beginning and was always available for any questions and/or suggestions. We loved the idea that we could borrow beach chairs. towels. coolers for the beach. and ice. Another thing that we will never forget is the view at the top where they serve a simple yet satisfying breakfast every morning‚Ä¶ the view is to die for! Both. my girlfriend and I. could not recommend this place enough. We loved it and we will certainly be coming back.
9993897,Jessi,April,2016,Completely exceeded our expectations. My boyfriend and I were looking for an affordable and clean room in a central area- what we found was beyond amazing. Sara was a friendly and helpful host with suggestions for adventures in the area. We really appreciated the light breakfast and coffee in the morning.Cannot wait to return to this beautiful paradise! Thank you so much for your hospitality!
9993897,Mark,March,2016,Our host Sarah was very welcoming and helpful. The room was as advertised. Location was ideal - walking distance to Pool Bar. Casa Verde. Saltaire. Tamboo. and Sandy Beach. Very pleased with everything. Would recommend to all.
9993897,Natalia,March,2016,Serenity was great. The suite #1 was very modern and clean. The bed was a king size and very comfortable. Bathroom was spacious and clean. It has a small fridge and a coffee maker. It has towels to shower and beach towels to use in the hot tub the place has. The only downside was that the TV was not working. The wifi signal is really weak in that room. Overall the place is perfect for a quiet getaway. It's walking distance to Sandy beach and the Tamboo; a place where you can eat and have a good time. Sara the host was very welcoming and helpful. I even lost a necklace in the room and once they cleaned it. they found it and she emailed me to let me know. I would definitely will come back.
9993897,Dan,March,2016,Sarah and the staff at Serenity were fantastic. The resort is beautiful and there is a hot tub with a great deck with an amazing view. The room was impeccably clean. and the bathroom was very nice with a large shower. The bed was extremely comfortable.  Staff was very friendly and helpful. They even give me towels to bring down to the beach. My girlfriend and I loved our experience there. We would definitely go back. It is close to a lot of restaurants. and Sandy beach as well as having plenty of parking
9993897,Natasha,February,2016,The place was exceptionally located to walk to restaurants and nightlife and the beach.  The bed was super comfortable and having a small pool on site was nice too. Love the shower and water pressure. We had the option to get daily room cleanings and beach towels were provided every day.  Sarah. the person who was in charge was such a pleasure to deal with and I couldn't think of a better experience. The only thing that was missing was it in unit full kitchen. but you can't have everything for this priceLoved our stay and would come back again!
9993897,Sara,February,2016,We stayed in Room 1 and it was beautiful! The bed was huge. everything was super clean. and the bathroom was modern and functional in every way. I hadn't realized that there was no internet in the room. so that was a bit of a surprise. but that fact was in the listing. so my fault for not reading. Sara was very sweet and helpful. she accommodated a late check in. and was there to talk to us about Rincon when we got there. The entire facility is really nice and in a great location. I will definitely be back!
9993897,Layla,January,2016,Thanks to Sara and staff for making us feel at home. Serenity is in a great location; close to beach. restaurants and bars in north Rincon. Upgraded from Room 1 to Room 11. which was a nice surprise - very clean. spacious. and loved that they provided kitchen utensils and supplies. Would definitely stay here again. Can't wait to return to Rincon!
9993897,Mark,January,2016,I stayed in Room 1. it was very nice--clean and everything seemed brand new. The bed was amazing/very comfortable like it looks in the picture. Sara the manager was very friendly. and happy to talk about Rincon. things to do. etc. Very close to the beach.
9993897,Justin,January,2016,Our stay at Serenity was so peaceful and serene. We really enjoyed the clean open feel of the property and room. It was a treat to fall asleep to the sound of nature and the distant waves. Sandy Beach was a quick walk down the hill and it was the perfect place to spend pre-breakfast. Thanks for the travel tips and hospitality.
9993897,Tommy,January,2016,Host is very welcoming and really enjoyed myself at serenity. Will definitely be back next time I am staying in rincon
9993897,Jussi,January,2016,We had a great time at Serenity and would recommend this for everyone. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. exactly like in the pictures. The location is very good with just a few minutes walk to good beaches and restaurants. Serenity also has a hot tub that can be used by all guests. It was really nice to dip in after a long day and relax in the hot water. We'd like to specially thank the owner for very good service. He would even lend us a hot plate so we were able to cook breakfast in the room.
9993897,Carlitos,January,2016,The experience at Serenity was simply amazing! Laura. the manager. did an impecable job with my requests and needs while in the property. Room was impecable and ready for me to enjoy in a peaceful and relaxing environment... Will definitely consider the place for a future visit to Rinc√≥n! And probably my new favorite place on earth!
9993897,Ricky,December,2015,Serenity was awesome. The place looks brand new. The room has everything you can need: brand new tv and fridge. and a super comfortable bed. The host Laura was super and gave great advise. The beaches were awesome and gorgeous and less than 5 minutes away.
9993897,Zack,December,2015,Highly recommended! Laura is a splendid host!!!' The rooms are superb and well priced! Location is great just 5 mins walk from beach with some great restaurants nearby! Wifi and car park is a plus! And some rather impressive views!

22586389,Dasha And John,September,2022,Good house
22586389,Melanie,July,2022,Spacious house. was perfect for our family holiday. Fantastic location right on the beach with the most beautiful patio to enjoy the spectacular sunsets..
22586389,Christian,July,2022,This beautiful home is located in a really nice area . great views . beautiful beaches .  the home was exactly as pictured and check in instructions were super easy . an amazing place to stay !!
22586389,Anya,June,2022,Great location.
22586389,Lola,January,2022,Our stay was wonderful in this place.  We spent New Years at this house. It‚Äôs two-story house with two units with independent entrance one on top of the other. but they share the backyard and access to the beach. Temperatures were pleasant during the day and night. we didn‚Äôt need to turn A/Cs on and the temperature of the water on the beach was very pleasant too. The most important thing and the true value of the house is in its location.  You open the back door of the house and you have the beach at your feet.  It can hold the most amazing sunsets since it‚Äôs located on the West of the island and the sun goes down just right there in front of you. Wait until it gets dark since after the sun sets. a range of intense colors begin to appear in the sky as the stars reveal themselves. Then you sleep to the sound of the waves crashing on the shore all night as some coquis make their unique sound.  As the morning arrives. some roosters from the street cackling wake you up. something absolutely Latino that gives a unique flavor to your stay.  The house is not soundproof so if you are looking for absolutely silence inside the house. this is not the place for you. You can hear your neighbors and dogs barking. The town doesn‚Äôt have public transportation. but there are markets and restaurants within walking distance.  If you want to explore beyond the town. you will need to rent a car or coordinate with the local tourism services to pick you up and drop you off at the house. Bring beach shoes and snorkels to go into the water. the beach has a long reef where you can explore sea life but uf you just want to chill out in the water. there is good space to do so too. Beds will do for short stay and we would say each unit will hold comfortably 4 people. If you need more beds they will provide cots. It has a TV in the living room with cable. Old books that you can read if you want to just chill on the beach and good wifi. To be honest. the place reminded us of the typical beach houses of our country (Venezuela).  No luxury but comfortable that has what we need for a short stay or vacation.Show more
22586389,Alan,November,2021,Perfect place for vacation in front beach with the best sunset in Puerto Rico!!
22586389,Response from Carol,July,2021,Although glad that you liked the location. it‚Äôs unfortunate you had so many negative things to say. I have to start by letting folks know that privately. you offered to remove your review if I paid you money which I hope people will see as a veiled extortion effort on your part. Points you mentioned: We have for many years very comfortably hosted 12 with no complaints whatsoever. You stated the dryer didn‚Äôt work- it was unplugged. The manager mentioned she would stop by to plug it in but you told her not to worry about it. The washer was working but needed a part to stabilize so it would not go out of balance. You were informed before check in the part was ordered and she was waiting for it to arrive. Meanwhile you had full use of the fully functional washer and dryer on the 2nd floor. You reserved for 10 people. 2 extra beds were set up for you. You must have invited guests that were not disclosed in the reservation or you would not have pulled air mattresses that were stored away in a closet. You were informed that beds were already set up for the amount of guests you paid for and again you told the manager not to worry about it. All linens and towels were purchased in the last 12 months. The price for this house is comparable to other houses with a similar location. You could have booked something less expensive but it may not have accommodated the amount of guests you had and you would not have had direct private beach access on a sandy swimming beach. I‚Äôm sorry you felt the need to be so negative but hopefully the majority of positive reviews will override yours.Show more
22586389,Lynette,June,2021,Great location and lovely view.  House is very comfortable. but too expensive for its condition inside.
22586389,Emma,April,2021,The location is amazing. The views are incredible especially the sunsets. We enjoyed our time at Carol‚Äôs place. Mostly cooking on the outdoor grill but also making a few trips to restaurants nearby. There are plenty of beach toys to entertain your family or friends. The host was very responsive. Definitely would stay here again.
22586389,Jose,April,2021,Everything you need. great for families. Beautiful view with direct access to the beach.
22586389,Pedro,March,2021,The place was really great
22586389,Pedro,January,2021,Great house in front of the beach. easy in and out access. Recommended for families with small children.

22586389,Angie,December,2020,Excellent location. The house is nice and clean with direct access to the beach. You will enjoy beautiful sunsets!
22586389,Gerardo,October,2020,Overall great beach house right next to the ocean. Nice and very well kept patio and exteriors. Amenities inside the house could improve a bit. Had a nice stay in the area.
22586389,Erin,July,2020,Very clean and perfect location. Mattresses in the bedrooms need updating and may cause pain for those with back issues. Communication was very quick and host was flexible to our requests. The view from the house priceless!
22586389,Erica,July,2019,"Great view. fun area of the island and it feels like a smaller version of San Juan.  We didn't surf but heard there is good surfing around this area.  Host responded quickly and spoke english.  I loved the little ""big"" things like seasonings for food and laundry detergent for washing clothes.  It was a sweet home!"
22586389,Jean,August,2018,Good accommodations. right on the water.  Good views from living room. kitchen. balcony and front porch.  Walking distance to supermarket and a few restaurants and bars. Quiet neighborhood. Site manager. Sabrina. was very helpful and responsive when we had the A/C breakdown in a bedroom

53549172,Garry,February,2022,Vero was very accommodating. Communication was very fast. The place was very clean and in a great location right across the street from Tamboo. Will definitely stay there again.
53549172,Valerie,February,2022,Great stay. Will be back
53549172,Hannah,February,2022,Great place and great location
53549172,Johanie,January,2022,Happiness is the perfect getaway experience in Rinc√≥n. The place is amazing!  As soon as you open the door to the patio you get that relaxing and luxurious vibe with access to a grill and the pool  while you relax. If you are up for adventure you cross the street to Sandy Beach. or go around the area looking for great beaches. surf spots. and food. Vero is a great host and have great recommendations for you to enjoy the Island.  It was great to have this amazing experience while supporting locals!
53549172,Maxwell,December,2021,Vero's place is right next to the beach. steps away from the Tamboo hotel. I highly recommend renting a car if you are staying here -- while you can theoretically make do without one. there are not many restaurants or other establishments near Vero's place. My understanding is that we were one of the first guests to stay in this unit. so there were a few hiccups. Primarily. the hot water in the unit did not work and the fix wasn't easy. However. Vero was communicative and willing to work with us to find a win-win solution. The pictures do a great job describing how the unit looks in real life.Overall. I am excited to see how this place matures as the initial kinks from being Vero's first guests work themselves out.Thank you for hosting us. Vero.
53549172,Silvia,July,2022,I loved the attention. the prompt answers to my questions. Everything was as we planned and the place is very nice but very clean. So good. everything is super accessible. We recommend it.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

Everything was super clean and we loved that each room came with beach towels. And the views from the balconies were just gorgeous. Each bedroom has AC and they work great. FYI. there are dogs next door that bark but that didn‚Äôt bother us. We also had a small issue with the stove and a few burners not working but that should get fixed! Overall. a great stay and would definitely recommend!
45422861,Andres,September,2021,Espectacular spot. Big balconies with sea breeze and views. Rooms and common areas are big and confortable. Near one of the best beaches of Rinc√≥n. Definitely a great place to stay with friends and family.
45422861,Eggie,August,2021,Nice view with great breeze. nice balcony space. and a big kitchen. Comfy beds with great A/C in all bedrooms. We wanted a place to relax. but there are a lot of dogs barking all day long from neighbors all around the property. It was difficult to talk on the balconies. and at night it was also difficult to get a good sleep. We had a good time. however this is not the place that you want to stay if you‚Äôre looking for a relax time.
45422861,Jose,July,2021,Nice house with ample space and close to the best places in Rincon.
45422861,Chris Melody,July,2021,This place was wonderful. Plenty of room and amenities. We loved cooking meals and eating on the main balcony (there are 3). Not too far from restaurants and quick drive to the beaches. Sooz is very responsive and helpful. Use her coordinates!

45422861,Cassie,January,2021,We got to be in community with the people there. Don't come here if you are expecting a hotel type experience. Yes there are dogs and cats and roosters and wild winds. Of course there are! Expect it! Any issues we had Red was quick to address. He went out of his way more than once to help us out. Thank you for being so readily available. He kept us very comfortable and gave great travel tips. I would definitely recommend this place. We watched fireworks as far as we could see off the balcony for hours on New Years Eve. Great show!! The house is close to everything . It's great to come back to after a long touristing day. Ya it works!

34575414,Adrian,July,2022,Johanna was wonderful and very communicative. We stayed at her her space for a week and it was too short of a stay!  It was very clean and had everything we needed for my family. It is close to everything needed (restaurants. beach. bars‚Ä¶etc). The personal covered pool was great during those rainy days! Beach chairs and umbrellas were provided for the short walk to the beach. The gated community is small and all the neighbors were super friendly. I would definitely stay here again (next time for longer!). Fully recommend!
34575414,Maria,July,2022,The location is great everything is just few minutes from the house walking distance restaurants and the beach. The house is in good condition private location with all the amenities you need for a vacation. The only downside for me was the pool inside the house I was not able to used it because for me it wasn‚Äôt clean enough and is really small. but the complex has a big one just right at the corner of the house and for me it‚Äôs a plus. Johanna is an excellent hostess she was always available for any questions. Overall it‚Äôs a nice place to stay for a family vacation. Very well recommend it. üòä

We really liked  our private pool so nice to take a dip after a day at the beach.

Pool area clean and well maintained. I recommend this place 100% Un lugar c√≥modo y m√°s grande que en las fotos. Cuarto Master es grande con un ba√±o privado c√≥modo. segundo cuarto es c√≥modo con una cama grande. Las literas son tan c√≥modos que cabe cualquier adulto sin problema. El aire del cuarto Master no funcionaba el d√≠a q fuimos pero Lysely me lo avia enformado y ya al d√≠asiguiente fue el t√©cnico y lo reparo (realmente no hace falta el aire ya q la brisa fresca de la playa sopla todo el dia).

As far as the area. very nice but be aware that the local establishments have very random hours of operation. The beach has strong currents so it‚Äôs not necessarily best suited for weak swimmers. however it‚Äôs gorgeous. All in all. it was a great experience.

It was very spacious. clean  and beautifully decorated with comfortable furniture and beds ( and bedding!).  The pool was great.  Our family enjoyed many hours there.  There are also lovely beaches just across the street or a short drive down the road where we made good use of the cooler. beach chairs and boogie boards that Lyselys provided.  We enjoyed the balcony. especially with our morning coffee.  The kitchen was well-equipped;  we made dinner several evenings.  The nearby Tamboo and Pool Bar were fun and delicious alternatives to eating in.  Add in the washer/dryer. parking space with security and this place was perfect for us!
27935782,Colby,January,2020,Lyselys was super accommodating and the unit is clean and beautiful with good location and proximity to Sandy Beach!
27935782,Emily,January,2020,Best beach stay  in a very cool location near the ocean. The apartment was a great base for exploring different beaches along the coast for surfing or snorkeling. Surf shop was 3 minutes away to rent surfboards. Our family of six had plenty of room in the modern apartment and we could walk to restaurants. Loved that there were books available. The host was very responsive and when the earthquake happened at 4:30am. she  texted to make sure we were ok. She kept in contact throughout the day about electricity.  We would love to come back and stay here again.
27935782,Mike,December,2019,Such a great spot!  Perfect location for anyone staying in Rincon area.  Great beaches. restaurants. bars and shops all within walking distance.  The apartment is clean. comfortable and well decorated.  We will definitely be back.  Thank you!

We were 6. but in the rooms can fit perfectly 8 people. Parking for 2 cars with gated access.

This home is literally steps away from the beach. The beds & pillows are comfortable.  the closets are large and each room had both AC & ceiling fan. With a group of 5 ladies we all had plenty of room to get ready! The kitchen is well stocked with utensils and other kitchenware. For entertainment there is a flat screen TV with internet connection to view Netflix etc. stereo & board games! Beach chairs & towels were on hand too. Also had a well made handbook full of information and resources for things to do in Rincon and locations of restaurants. medical services & food delivery etc. - very handy!! The neighborhood & neighbors are all friendly and every morning you‚Äôre greeted with a warming ‚Äúbuenos d√≠as‚Äù from the locals :) & engaging conversations.If you‚Äôre looking for a ‚Äúhome sweet beach home‚Äù in a prime location near beaches. restaurants. shopping etc this is it. highly recommend!!

1024520,Daniel,October,2021,Perfect location. great host
1024520,Brenda,September,2021,Daniel is a great host. Everything was clean and it‚Äôs near to nice places. We will come back soon! We love Rincon.
1024520,Victor Kidwell,September,2021,Greetings! Well my stay was great. When arriving Daniel was waiting for me (it was almost 9pm) and showed me around the property before leaving. The place has an outstanding location. walking distance to restaurants and beaches. Yes. I recommend this place for anyone searching for a nice time in Rinc√≥n. Thanks for everything Daniel. hope to see you soon.
1024520,Corey,September,2021,Great stay!
1024520,Heriberto,August,2021,Nice and quiet area. Overall satisfying stay. Could use some upgrades. However. would revisit.
1024520,Alejandra,July,2021,The house was fresh and clean. The rooms are spacious and the location is perfect. it has a lot of restaurants/bars around and the beach is right there.
1024520,Emmanuel,July,2021,Great location and place!! Very close to the beach and nice little bar
1024520,Darines,July,2021,Daniel was such a great host! We did a late check in and he was on the phone with me to make sure we didn‚Äôt get lost. The space was super clean and after a long day of travel it was nice to find dinning options right across the street. The terrace with hammocks was also a great treat! Thanks again for hosting us Daniel!
1024520,Joshua,July,2021,Awesome Place to stay. Highly recommended.
1024520,Alexandra,July,2021,This is a great spot that is close to so many beaches. 10 minutes from the main town square. and has a couple of great bars within a couple of blocks. Daniel was super responsive and very helpful with anything I needed and I can't recommend this place enough.
1024520,Eric,June,2021,I enjoyed my time at Daniel's locale. It was clean and as advertised. This is a great place if you're planning on being out on road trips most of the time. The beach community is pretty isolated. so not terribly busy with some good restaurants in the area.
1024520,Ariel,June,2021,Very good and clean.
1024520,Josh,June,2021,Best location on Sandy Beach.  Loved everything about it.
1024520,Kerri,June,2021,We didn‚Äôt actually get to stay at Daniel‚Äôs place because he has a ‚Äúno pets.‚Äù policy and we were traveling with our dog. He was very kind to us. and responsive to communication. and cooperative in getting us a refund from AirBnB when we realized it wouldn‚Äôt be possible to stay at his place.
1024520,Beatrice,May,2021,This was just what I needed! Walking distance to the beach. food and some gift shops. Daniel is an awesome host! I will be back!
1024520,Lorenzo,May,2021,Great spot with very good accommodation very close to the beach. restaurants and some night life. We had an amazing time and will definitely stay again in the future.
1024520,Wenlin,May,2021,Daniel is super host. He knows every you need about local informations.He even knows when is local sunrise schedule too. Thx for everything Daniel. See you later.
1024520,Robert,May,2021,Great location and Daniel was available on site and was very attentive. I would definitely return if needed. The place is very secure as well.
1024520,Theresa,May,2021,Daniel is a very friendly host. great communication and the Airbnb is right across the beach in walking distance. Thank you for everything.
1024520,Naor,May,2021,Good location place.
1024520,Laura And Michael,May,2021,The one bedroom studio is extra clean and an ideal location. (especially these days since 9:00 pm curfew keeps the noise down from the bar next door). and it's steps to our favorite surf spots. It's particularly wonderful if you plan to spend most of your time away from the apartment and mainly need a place to sleep and keep your things (but not as much if you plan to relax there or have any work to do that depends on phone and wi-fi connections because both signals are weak). Construction/repair was going on during our stay. so most of the outside space was unavailable. but ordinarily it looks like it would be lovely. Also. a new pool is under construction that should add significantly to the enjoyment of the facilities. The room is minimally equipped. (for example. no beach towels. wash clothes. hand towels. paper towels. floor mat. drinking glasses. dish towel) but feel free to ask for things you need because Daniel and Zodie are very accomodating. It's walking distance to the beach and restaurants--couldn't be a better location!
1024520,Jenny,April,2021,The location of this Airbnb is amazing! Close to everything in the village. Daniel is the most solution oriented and professional host. he is also kind and helpful. I can really recommend a stay here instead of in Rinc√≥n. We‚Äôd love to come back and we highly recommend this place!
1024520,Tanner,April,2021,Daniel was super cool and very helpful he was flexible with an early check in which helped me offload my bags. He also helped me change and flat tire and let me know where to go to get it patched. all around great guy.
1024520,Arli,April,2021,Great location!
1024520,Mark,March,2021,Great spot in a great location. Daniel was helpful and accommodating.
1024520,Brian,February,2021,Look - you're here to be at the beach. It certainly delivers on that.  Daniel gave us a lot of tips on restaurants nearby and was very good about communicating on check-in
1024520,Marc,February,2021,Great place
1024520,Ernesto,January,2021,Awesome place!
1024520,Judyth,January,2021,Daniel was very attentive and courteous. We did a last minute booking and Daniel didn't hesitate to show us the place and help us with our stay. Most definitely recommend this place for it's location. accessibility and staff.
1024520,Assafurban,January,2021,Great room. great local tips. great beach access. great mattress. great common areas. Would stay again 10/10.
1024520,Getulio,December,2020,Excellent Location. value and Fun!
1024520,Kiara,December,2020,Great place
1024520,Roberto,November,2020,Daniel is a great host of a perfectly located place.
1024520,Jean,November,2020,Nice place to stay! Very strategic.
1024520,Maria,October,2020,Great Location. Daniel has been a great.
1024520,Nydia,August,2020,Daniel is an excellent host. His hospitality and attention. even when we sent the request for stay the same day he accommodated us right away. During check out we left a medicine on the fridge and they even called us and we were able to go back and get it. Thank you Daniel for everything. Definitely recommended and staying in the future.
1024520,Jose,July,2020,Great host. very nice place!!
1024520,Emilio,July,2020,Place its very close to sandy beach
1024520,Jennifer,February,2020,Great spot! Close to the beach
1024520,Jesse,February,2020,Such a great place. 10/10 would recommend and hoping to come back.
1024520,Luis,February,2020,Good place in a good location close to Sandy Beach. bars and restaurants. The host was easy to communicate with. The only bad thing for me was the super loud music from the bar right next to the place. Were not able to sleep until after 2am.

1024520,Response from Daniel,November,2021,The only problem with communication is yourself. You instant booked the studio. neglected to mention  you had a very large dog and if pets are permitted. I did confront you when you were leaving and your girlfriend was sneaking the dog out. You just didn't like being confronted  about your lying. You stated that I didn't have it listed on the website. total lie. You have no regard for anyone's medical condition that you may jeopardize. So when you talk about attitudes. you have no sense of responsibility. Right now you're you're attacking my lodgings and me simply because i confronted you on lying about the dog. People can see right through your dishonesty. Good luck in lifeShow more

45366792,Calvin,September,2022,This stay was amazing couldn't ask for a better experience from the pool to the view and all the fruit trees it was spectacular can't wait to come back!!!!!
45366792,Sherry,August,2022,Our whole stay was wonderful. The house is beautiful and clean. and in a great location. The pool was larger than we anticipated & kept beautifully! We used it every day. We sat on the patio area and enjoyed the amazing views. Rachel was very helpful with any questions we had & got back to us almost immediately. It was a great vacation. We‚Äôll definitely be back!
45366792,Nathan,August,2022,Excellent location and wonderful hosts. We will be back.
45366792,Gabby,July,2022,Beautiful views and very nice house. nice clean pool. Despite the house being perfectly clean there is a issue with roaches. when it rains too hard there are small ones that come out. Once I contacted the property manager she sent someone out to handle it. There is constant open communication with the manager of the property which I enjoy. There is also a abundance of spices. coffee. and fruit. Overall it was a nice place to stay with views and a pool to die for.
45366792,Johanna,July,2022,We enjoyed our stay. The house has a beautiful view. close to the beach and restaurants. We had a problem with the gate and it was addressed immediately. I love that the property is private and has an ocean view. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you for an amazing experience.
45366792,Luis,July,2022,This is a great place. The pool is amazing. Great communication. We enjoyed our stay here.
45366792,Anita,June,2022,Fantastic towels and comfortable beds. Great place to stay. Rooms were spacious and comfortable.  We only cooked one meal but I can imagine that it would be easy to do many more.  Plenty of spices and adequate space & appliances. Had one issue that was addressed the same day.  One bathroom needs some attention and was a musty.  Beautiful vegetation in the back and it‚Äôs wonderful to listen to the birds and the frogs.  We loved Sandy Beach which was a short drive. can‚Äôt imagine walking the hills and curves to get there. Felt very safe in the house & area. The staff was very attentive and had excellent communication. We had a wonderful stay.  Mango Beach Shop - very charming.   Sana Farm to Table - good lunch.   La Cambija - best meal we have had all year.
45366792,Max,June,2022,Great location. Great AC. Beautiful indoor and outdoor space. 10/10
45366792,Savannah,June,2022,Such an amazing house. beautiful views and close to the beach & restaurants around the area. Property manager was amazing including the owner. Very clean. enough towels everything I needed was here in this beautiful home. I would definitely come back to visit love the Ricon!!
45366792,Schaquanna,May,2022,I had one of the best birthday‚Äôs here!!! Very friendly. communication was great. went above and beyond and I will DEFINITELY be returning
45366792,Elizabeth,May,2022,Such a beautiful house in a great location with spectacular views. a short yet steep walk to the beach. we preferred to drive it though.  the house was cleanand well equipped with more than enoough towels for the 5 people that were traveling with me. There was plenty of seating in the comon areas for a large group. and I cant rave enough about the pool.  The hosts were very helpful and responsive. they had wonderful recommendations for food and drink and activities. This was all of our first times in PR and Rincon. we will definitely be back for a stay.
45366792,Jessica,April,2022,Beautiful views and lovely home. Owner is fantastic
45366792,Christopher,March,2022,Our stay at this Rincon house could not have been better. The house was very comfortable and in the most beautiful area. Pay attention to the check in directions so you can find the place easily. and watch the narrow roads - but once you get to the house you will be so excited. Remarkable views all around. and in a quiet. safe spot. The pool and observation deck are real bonuses. One of my favorite stays ever!
45366792,Zach,February,2022,Great Stay. highly responsive. a lot of deck space in pool area and roof top. easy walk to Sandy Beach. coffee. and shops.
45366792,Response from Mary Brittany,March,2022,Hi Michael.This is actually Patricia. the owner that was on-site during the Beginning of your stay. Only Mary Brittany‚Äôs account allows responses but she was out of town that week. First of all I am sorry you feel this way about your stay and our prices. We are actually priced lower than comparable properties in the area. When I came by to see how things were going you and your wife told me everything was great. If you had such concerns you should have told me then however I can address them again. I can attest to the fact I did not have friends over as I was on a zoom for an online class all day for my doctorate. A friend dropped a surfboard off at one point which perhaps took a 90 seconds and he didn‚Äôt even come into the property. When you did begin listing your complaints in the messages to our property manager Rachel. which were also visible to us. she was very polite and patient with you. This included refilling the water jugs multiple times and proving more amenities than included. Typically guests get two jugs. 10 gallons. and are responsible for their own supplies beyond that. This is more than many places. Our past guests have all had great experiences with her. She bent over backwards to try and make your stay more enjoyable. While we agree there shouldn‚Äôt have been trash by the pool nor a roach on the ground we did our best to make it up to you. Unfortunately the cleaners somehow missed it. The number of seats at the outside table is no different in real life than in the picture. When the you brought it to our attention that the bench was broken inside we had someone come fix it. It was not broken before your arrival.We offered you the opportunity to find a new place and refund the majority of your stay and you stopped responding. This is not a hotel. it is a vacation home on a Caribbean Island. We wish you better luck on your future travels.Show more
45366792,Patrick,January,2022,This house was great! Great location in Puntas!! The house was clean. everything as advertised. The pool was wonderful to hang out at after a day at the beach and the outdoor shower was nice as well to rinse. Communication was great during a power outage(generator on site which was awesome) and a water issue (all typical of Puntas) and the welcome book at the house outlines in detail how to navigate any issues you may have. Britt was staying at the place next door with her pup guapo and they both were wonderful! Can‚Äôt thank you enough! We will be back!
45366792,Response from Mary Brittany,January,2022,Thank you so much Kerry! We would love to have you back any time
45366792,Katie,December,2021,We had a great stay. Enjoyed our location. our space to spread out. and the privacy. House was plenty spacious for our family of 5. Great host
45366792,Laura,November,2021,Thank you Mary and Rachel. We needed a family getaway. We truly enjoyed our stay in your place. The morning and evening views from the terrace were lovely; and start gazing was breathtaking. The pool is great and distant enough from the main home that we felt our toddler was safe. We felt safe at all times and enjoyed the tranquility of the neighborhood. The home is walking distance to nice restaurants on the beach and for a great morning walks. Rachel was a great host. responded immediately and solved any situation that came up with diligence.
45366792,Luz F,August,2021,Sound nice place
45366792,Felix,July,2021,Amazing place. very beautiful ! Love the area. the house was great. Pool was awesome and the host (Rachel) treated us amazingly. very nice and excellent communication. I would  definitely go again and I will recommend to friends and family !
45366792,Joseph,June,2021,Wow-what a great stay with Brittney and Mary. Love the location. the neighbors. the food (WOW!). the island. and the host (Brittney). You will enjoy your stay! A perfect score of 10. (First time I have given this rating) My family looks forward to staying here again. Regards. Joe S.
45366792,Bermarie,May,2021,This place is beautiful and very welcoming.  The neighborhood is really peaceful and the host was very nice to all of us.  The pool. the view. the house. for me was all I want it and more. Hope to be back soon!
45366792,Marlaine,May,2021,Great location. exactly shown as the pictures. We hope to come back soon and see more. Everything was great.

45366792,Brady,April,2021,Our stay at Brittany's house was amazing! The house was beautiful and clean and the property was incredible. The pool area is wonderful and is surrounded by beautiful palm and fruit trees. We were within walking distance to some of the best local spots as well as the beach. Brittany was an amazing host who provided us awesome tips on where to go. We are already planning a trip back! Highly recommend this place!
45366792,Mariel,March,2021,Beautiful view of the ocean. Great pool and terrace area!
45366792,Valerie,March,2021,Great view. nice pool . and excellent communication.
45366792,Christopher,March,2021,Highly recommend!
45366792,Kathryn,March,2021,What a great stay! We loved our extended time at Britt‚Äôs awesome home. We had everything at our fingertips with the perfect location...amazing outdoor space and large private pool. Britt was an amazing host. We arrived to a well appointed kitchen and coordinated a grocery order in advance - so convenient!! Britt was always readily available for any questions or to give us recommendations on how to make the most of our visit. We loved our stay and can‚Äôt recommend this home enough. It was perfect for our kids (ages 5 and 2.5) but I‚Äôll also add that a few years back. we stayed here with two other couples for a kids free vaca!
45366792,Christine,January,2021,Wow!  Where to begin?  We had such a wonderful stay at Mary Brittany's house.  From our inquiry about her house. Mary Brittany was quick to communicate and thoroughly answered our questions.  Check in was convenient and easy.  The property is so beautiful.  We have 3 kids and there was plenty of space for them to play and explore.  The pool area was a great place to relax if we weren't feeling the beach.  The pool has a gate access so we could rest easy our little one wasn't going to sneak down there.  There is also a large back patio with a BBQ.  We enjoyed many days working from the outside table and eating outside at night.  The property also has plenty of off street parking and is behind a gate.  You truly feel you are in your own world.  The back yard has an avocado tree which we were fortunate to catch the end of its season.  Delish!  There's also banana trees and a soursop tree - this tree we had to lookup and enjoyed getting to experience local fruits right in our back yard!  Inside you will find everything you need for an enjoyable stay.  Air Conditioning. back up water and a generator were great amenities to have as well for reassurance.  The house is located near so many great beaches.  You can walk to a handful of beaches and jump in your car for a short drive to experience plenty more.  You are also close to downtown Rincon but just far enough away that you feel you have your own tropical getaway.  The Puntas are truly magical in that way.  One thing to note is we stayed during COVID and Puerto Rico had implemented many restrictions.  Even this all the restrictions (restaurants with limited operating days/hours. some shops not open. certain attractions not available) we still had an INCREDIBLE time.  We would happily stay again.  The experience and Mary Brittany's home is worth every penny of the price.Show more
45366792,Response from Mary Brittany,November,2020,Thank you so much Nancy!
45366792,Gillian,October,2020,What a dream!!!!! Brits place was spectacular. Extremely clean. amenities were perfect. beds were so comfortable. and the pool was FANTASTIC. Any questions were quickly answered and Brit gave us the insider scoop on all the best local spots!! We were so surprised how quick the walk was to the most beautiful beach we‚Äôve ever seen! Perfect location. The fruit trees around the property were such a bonus as well. I could not recommend this place more to anyone/everyone traveling to Rincon!

5047985,Paola,July,2022,We were received with a warm welcome from the host Richard. he gave us an exciting tour and gave us our room‚Äôs key. it‚Äôs appliances we‚Äôre new like the AC and the refrigerator. it was fully equipped with silverware and everything we needed. It also had great water pressure and warm water. the pool is beautiful and has an amazing view of both the coast and a cute cow field.  Richard always responded us when we needed him and was a great host. if we ever can we will definitely stay again.
5047985,Jannett,July,2022,Perfect stay- close to everything. Perfect location with a great pool.

5047985,Chris,February,2022,Richard is so welcoming and helpful.   Truly cares about our experience and happy to help with anything.   Highly recommend.   Amazing sunsets!
5047985,William,February,2022,one of the best places I‚Äôve stayed! Great views and Richard is awesome. highly recommend!
5047985,Danielle,February,2022,This is a chill spot. About a 20 min walk down a large hill to a close beach thats beautiful. The view on the balcony is amazing. but not very close. You will definitely prefer a car to get to beach and main Rinc√≥n. I think there are a few overlooked things in the room that could make it excellent and more comfortable. but nothing the owner cant or wont do for you. Maybe just ask. The rains/floods on the island made us a little later than the 8pm check-in. I had an emergency online interview and was helped to ensure i had strong wifi for it. Its not a luxurious room but its doable. I believe this place will only get better! And I cannot wait to see what it becomes of it.
5047985,Nadia,January,2022,It was a great stay
5047985,Christian,September,2021,Smooth check in. amazing views. clean. Has everything you need. Don‚Äôt hesitate to book!
5047985,Megan,August,2021,AMAZING apartments to stay in the beautiful Rincon! The apartments have everything you need and the view is just breathtaking. Great spot in town so if you don‚Äôt have a car. it‚Äôs only a short walk to the beach and restaurants. There is even a great restaurant next door! Lorenzo and Richard were great to talk to if you ever need help. I know I will be back so I 100000% recommend:)
5047985,Gladimarie,July,2021,Nice. big. comfortable. clean. peaceful place. Response is quick. English and Spanish language. Close to lots of places. Microwave is not working and air conditioner drips water but is really cold perfect for nice sleep after hot day. Kitchen resolves pretty well and supermarket near by. Parking in street or behind the inn.
5047985,Christina,June,2021,Great place to stay in a quiet area of rinc√≥n. We booked our stay very last minute since we were checking out from a stay in isla verde and had to drive back to aguadilla to catch a flight home . Lorenzo was super helpful on guiding us to the room . The room was clean and cute ! Had all the amenities including a little stove top . refrigerator and a microwave. The view was stunning also. We grabbed dinner down by the beach and brought it up to our room which was 10 minutes away . Over all great hospitality will definitely book again
5047985,Siqiao,April,2021,If you have difficulty locating the place. try searching Casa Vista Del Mar. which is the name of the inn that this place was at. Communication with the host was difficult but Lorenzo (the guy taking care of the place) was awesome
5047985,Laura,April,2021,Great location on the outsides downtown Rinc√≥n and great sunset viewings.

5047985,Pedro,November,2020,Great host.
5047985,Lola,October,2020,Check-in: complicated since the drop pin on here is not where the place actually is. Communication: man was really nice and welcoming which makes me feel bad about writing this review. but it truly must be done. View: magnificentBed: very comfortable and smelled clean. Kitchen: also not clean but functional so that was ok. Bathroom: FILTHY! Toilet bowl.  toilet seat and the shower! We are talking hairs in the drain.  walls and what i can't even believe in the toilet seat and bowl. The shower road should be changed. Just no hygiene overall. Given COVID times.  I am in shock this is how they are operating.
5047985,Sael J.,October,2020,Richard is very friendly. His place has a very nice sunset view. The location is convenient because there is a lot of food restaurants. beaches and all you can need within a 5 minute driving distance. Will definitely stay again!
5047985,Carolyn,October,2020,Great location. close to many restaurants and a beautiful view
5047985,Fernando,October,2020,Nice!
5047985,Rouman,September,2020,Amazing view and very centric. Will definitely book again!!
5047985,Johnny,September,2020,Great place!! Perfect to rest and have a nice view!!
5047985,Seashell,August,2020,Richard was quick to respond. he even checked us in late. We had our own parking spot. the room has a really nice view of the ocean. it has a kitchen. a/c and wifi. It‚Äôs really quiet there. Great and effective response. nice. We really enjoyed our stay there. we‚Äôre definitely coming back.
5047985,Marion,July,2020,We were 4 people but the room is better fitted for a couple. The 2 camp beds weren‚Äôt ready when we arrived and we were missing a pillow but the view from the room was worth it. The kitchen was not clean when we cooked but the bathroom was fine and modern. I think to help people find the place it would be better to have the GPS coordinates but we managed to find it thanks to Richard‚Äôs indications. Also there is no breakfast included like indicated on Airbnb.But overall it‚Äôs a good quality price and the view from the balcony is great!
5047985,Gloryanne,June,2020,Great place. the air conditioner could be better. But overall had a great stay. The host was very attentive 24/7.
5047985,Herbert,June,2020,Great place!!!! very nice and clean....it was great and the view was amazing!!!! I'll be back!!!!
5047985,Juan,February,2020,We managed to do a check in late in the night. Service was awesome. Nice view. also.

5047985,Susan,January,2019,We were amazed with the view from balcony. Special treat watching the sunset. Richard was a super host; friendly and very helpful. Place was very clean and so very comfortable. We just wished we could have stayed longer!! Next time

5047985,Yarimar,June,2018,Thank you Richard for you hospitality!!
5047985,Ixchel,May,2018,This place is great. with lots of potential‚Äî only needs a little bit of love. If you‚Äôre looking for a simple studio place for a long stay. this is perfect. Must have a car to get to it. The view is awesome in the morning. Everything in the place is in working condition. I‚Äôll go back for the value in a longer stay. However. this place is not for picky travelers or anyone looking for luxury or great amenities.

5047985,Edgar,July,2016,Very friendly host. beautiful view and comfortable rooms. Recommended
5047985,Jose,March,2016,We had a great time whike staying at Casa Vista del Mar. The room was clean and big with a great balcony to watch the sunset! Richart was a great host. alway eith a smike. he even offer to meet us in the main highway because we miss the entrance to the street.  I recoment Casa del Mar!
5047985,Bianca,March,2016,This is my 3rd time staying at Casa Vista Del Mar. but first time staying in a different room than previous trips. The sunset and view was just as beautiful as I remembered it to be!  Richard really wasn't in communication before our arrival like he has been in previous stays. I'm going to assume it was because he knew I had stayed before-- but there was no communication concerning directions or arrival time. so I'm happy I remembered where I was going and how to get there. We were greeted by some of his friends when we got there that had to go find him to check us in. which felt awkward. Every other stay we have been contacted by and greeted by him and check-in has run very smoothly. so I'm going to hope this was an off day. In previous visits I have stayed in the 1 bedroom apartments. but this time I stayed in a studio. This was not intended. apparently the wrong room was booked (my fault) and we asked to switch to a 1 bedroom. but told they were unavailable and instead Richard offered us another studio for the same price as the one we rented. but we politely declined.  After staying in both. I would recommend the 1 bedrooms over the studio's; they are better well kept. The roll away beds are relatively new (I think one of them was fresh out of the box) and are comfortable-- easy to get a good night's rest on! You really can't beat the view from Casa Vista Del Mar-- it is phenomenal to wake up to. The location isn't bad either. a short drive from the center of town and a little bit further from Sandy and Domes beaches. It is a relatively cheap stay with priceless views!Show more
5047985,Fredrik,January,2016,Very accomodating and friendly host. he responded quickly to our booking request and met up with us to show the way to the accomodation.   The room was large with a spectacular view from the balcony. Only thing missing would be Wi-Fi coverage in the room. Was working well from the shared terrace.
5047985,Lizzie,January,2016,The room was comfortable. and the view was lovely. Richard welcomed us on arrival and let us hang out in the main balcony area. However there was mouldy food in the cupboards. and the fridge smelled awful. He told us we could leave the key in the kitchen when we left in the morning but when we did this. I recieved a very rude text message from Richard saying that he thought it was incredibly rude that we didnt bring the key up. It was a very innaproppriate message and upset our day. I would not recommend this.
5047985,Response from Richard M,January,2016,Thank you I hope you enjoy the rest of your stay Richie Casa Vista Del Mar
5047985,Jose Alejandro,July,2015,Nice place to stay. great view and have a lot of places near. also the beach. will recomend
5047985,Juan Manuel,July,2015,Nice stay! Richard was very friendly.
5047985,Zaimara,April,2015,The place is terrific and therapeutic. It is exactly as described and the owner is a very warm hearted person. Will definitely return soon for a longer stay.  For those interested in the place. the studios are located on a hilltop overlooking Rinc√≥n. It is a gorgeous view. Sometimes you just need to get away from it all and this is exactly the place. I recommend it!
5047985,Liz,March,2015,Richard's place is located at the top of a hill which is the perfect spot for watching the sunset. Richard is very helpful and collected us when we couldn't find our way. The studio has everything we need and we had a great time.

It's nothing modern (I would recommend updating a little. main air conditioning). When I arrived (6 pm). although check in said from 3 pm. the studio was not yet clean or ready. I had to leave and come back half an hour later. at Richard's request. in what they made the bed and finished cleaning it. Parking is a very steep end to a very steep slope.

51483916,Leighann,April,2022,This place is absolutely amazing!!! Perfect location. Can‚Äôt say enough about our stay here. The host even let us borrow a cooler and filled the gas when it was empty for the grill! WE WILL BE BACK!! Also. if you love to find beautiful and even some rare pieces of sea glass this location has TONS and beautiful shells as well. The beaches are quiet and wonderful for long walks. The surf is epic too!
51483916,Holly,March,2022,Beautiful villa. great location just steps from the spectacular beach. You can see the ocean from the roof deck. which was a beautiful spot for sun and shade. The entire place was spotless. the linens and towels were fresh and clean. and the beds and pillows were super comfortable! The villa had all the amenities. along with everything you‚Äôd want for the beach. Waleska‚Äôs guidebook. the publications in the villa and recommendations from the gate staff made us feel like we experienced the best of Rincon. It was a wonderful stay and I‚Äôm already looking at dates to go back.
51483916,Rolf,February,2022,Wonderful place to stay. Everything is clean and neat. It‚Äôs very close to the beach. The beach is a surfing beach. so has quite some waves. But the tide pools are great with kids or for relaxing. The pool is somewhat disappointing. but not really an issue as the beach is the star here.
51483916,Jim,January,2022,The place is amazing and Waleska was very fast to respond. She is a true professional and the place was very clean. VERY well stocked with everything you could need for the beach. You can see the beach from the terrace and room balconies.Our family had a terrific time.
51483916,Gina,January,2022,We loved staying at this place!  Everything is as pictured and it was wonderful to be able to see the ocean every day.  The house is very clean and very well equipped especially the kitchen.   The beds were very comfortable.  The host was very helpful if needed.  If you are a surfer the beach had some nice waves when we were there.  It's not a great swimming beach but still pretty.  It was a short drive to town but definitely need a car.   The development felt very secure with the front gate having security 24/7.   The only small thing is the pool isn't quite as nice as pictured but it's ok.  We also traveled during covid so perhaps it's nicer when furnished. etc.  Overall. wonderful stay and can't wait to return!
51483916,Kathy,December,2021,It is a fabulous house and we would definitely rent it again. Waleska communicated with us a lot ahead of time to answer many questions about the area and give us ideas for activities. Paradise!!!
51483916,Eric,December,2021,Waleska was an incredible Airbnb host! She made the check-in process seamless and was regularly in touch about our stay. The villas are located right on the beach and are a short drive away from downtown Rincon. I would highly recommend staying here and plan to visit again!
51483916,Irmaliz,November,2021,Great Host
51483916,Michele,November,2021,Our family had an awesome week here!!! Great location to everything in Rincon. just make sure you have a car if you want to venture out.
51483916,Rob,October,2021,Waleska was an awesome host. Super friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend this place - especially for any surfers. Access to the break right out front or any of the ones within walking distance down the beach was prime.
51483916,Henry,October,2021,Great view. location and amazing layout ELITE host already trying to plan our next visit
51483916,Migxenia,September,2021,Excellent location. very equipped place. Waleska was great. Had a wonderful weekend.
51483916,Edwind,August,2021,location is close to many beaches . the small town is full of joy with live music and restaurants with great food
51483916,Aslin,August,2021,A very spacious and clean villa. but  bathrooms are a small and the kitchen could be brighter.  Very well equipped kitchen. We were a family of 5 and had plenty of space to spread out.  Rooftop terrace is great with ocean view. AC's in all rooms worked perfectly. Cell receptions is not great. but WIFI and cable TV worked fine. Waleska is a great host. communication was very good. She is very responsive and was quick to resolve any issues we had. Would definitely recommend this Villa to friends and family.

50875361,Elsa,July,2022,Ocean view; not beach. also you would need a car to get to town. Rincon is amazing
50875361,Amy,April,2022,Lots of space to relax on the 2 bunk beds. 1 queen bed and 2 couches! The balcony has a partial ocean AND mountain view. Communication with host was prompt and would recommend staying here. especially if you have transportation! Getting taxis can be difficult and the main center of town is a bit of a walk. but you can call for a taxi if you are lucky or plan in advance. The beach towels were a nice touch as well as the fully equipped kitchen. Thank you for a lovely stay!
50875361,David,December,2021,We really enjoyed our stay. Only 10min drive from surf beaches. The apt itself has everything you need. There is really nothing bad to say here. The only minor critique is that the beds were pretty squeeky if you toss and turn at night. and the coffee machine kept overflowing and didn't really work. The sunrise every mornig was beautiful. Overall. we highly recommend this place!
50875361,William,December,2021,Great location and spacious! We had a good stay overall. During early AM hours roosters singing and very noise parking garage doors of near apartments were not pleasant. Appliances were cleaned and in working order although outdated. Leaving room. kitchen.

37386154,Cesar,July,2022,Perfect
37386154,Annie,May,2022,The house is comfortable. well located near the town of Rincon. PR yet you need a car to get to the nearest beach (15-20 minute drive). I recommend you bring your bathroom and bed linen since in the house there are not plenty and there is no washer/dryer to cleanse the few that are available. Last. it is pet friendly and a quiet neighborhood.
37386154,Evan,February,2022,Clean. quiet and homey place right next to all that Rincon has to offer but far enough away from the main drag that it feels peaceful and serene. I would recommend this place to anyone and would stay here again in a heartbeat. We had a lot of trouble finding a quiet. clean place in Rincon and this place was perfect. Also. Syl. the caretaker in Rincon was fabulous to work with. Thanks again for a five star stay üòÅ

37386154,Response from Maricarmen,April,2021,Sorry to hear that you didn‚Äôt like the property during your emergency trip to PR.  We take these matters very seriously and appreciate your recommendations.After careful review of these claims. we must clarify on the following matters:	‚ÅÉ	the house goes thru professional cleaning after each rental.  Cleaning issues should be reported immediately to the host or me. - the house was reserved for 6 people.   Additional guests need prior coordination with either the host or me.- Rental did not offer beach chairs. extra towels. washer or dryer.  Hot water was available. The master bathroom runs hot water and temperature levels varies depending on its usage.  However. we have just installed a dedicated heater to the small bathroom to improve this issue.We assured you that matters would have been resolved different if prior to departure. we were given the opportunity to fix/improve any issues.  I was not notified of these things except for your review.  We regret of your experience.  We strive to provide our guest with a great stay and based on the rental agreement.  Anything additional. should have been coordinated prior to rental or  during rental time.  Be well and Thanks for staying in Villa Nevado.Show more

53726859,Joshua,July,2022,I want to admit that the place is spectacular. Two or three things that can be improved in the physical space. for example. the outdoor lights go out alone at night and there is no lighting outside. It also didn't have an iron. But the worst thing is the service. I stayed with my friends and it turns out that we went to bed around 3am and at 6am there was noise from a construction project they are doing on the property themselves. The girls were in their room and saw builders passing by and they were sleeping. No one could sleep from 6am. Then at 8am we were up again after we were sleeping touching. so that we moved the cars because they had to move some things for construction.  We had to lock ourselves in order to park the cars. To top it all off. we were talking on some chairs that were in the courtyard and guess what. we dropped cement from the sky. When we looked up the builders were setting up a concrete column for us being downstairs. You imagine some barrel or wood falling off on us. That's a danger. that's why in the buildings there is a protective helmet. and we on our vacation exposed to that danger. I have to admit that even though the place is perfect for groups. The team that manages it is irresponsible. They prefer to put their guests at risk so they can keep earning while they expand their space than to wait to finish construction and be responsible. I think Airbnb needs to get them out of the market until they're done. They were asked to stop the construction while we were there and they never did. They have no construction permits or anything. The truth is that these people do not deserve that anyone renting that place again because they are exposing their guests to that a danger is their vacation that can end in the hospital.Show moreTranslated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

11692633,Response from Guanica,March,2022,Eric and wife were great guests. They stayed for the whole month and took great care of our property. We wish them to come back soon . Excellent people.
11692633,Gabriela,November,2021,Great value stay - all the necessities plus a little more. Beach equipment was great to have!
11692633,Response from Guanica,November,2021,Yes. Our property has a great location and is about 1-2 min walking distance  to the beach. We have several restaurants that you can walk to. There is also a great area to snorkel in our beach area.   Of course with people going in and out with beach gear. suitcases and our paddleboard . we have some minor wall  scratches. Nothing to get all exited no big deal. We paint our property either yearly or every two years.  FYI. our property is just about 4 years old. so its pretty brand new and recent. All our furniture is about that same age  but  to say that everything is old is sort of misleading. I know people have different taste in things and that you cant please all people all the time.Show more
11692633,Response from Guanica,November,2021,Thank you for the review.  anything we can do to help our guests. of course we will do it. If we have no other guests we can get you an early check in or late checkout. Come back soon any time.

11692633,Rosa,June,2021,Great place within walking distance to the beach and few restaurants. and just across from community pool. Highly recommended.
11692633,Milagros,May,2021,Everything you need to spend a relaxing time next to the beach with the family. This house has all the essentials plus some extras to enjoy beach and poolactivities. The place is quite and the neighbors are friendly.
11692633,Maria,April,2021,Guanica‚Äôs place is a cozy house next to the beach. Its proximity to the beach and access to a kayak and paddle board enabled us to enjoy aquatic activities without having to use our cars.The house is in a gated urbanization that is safe and quiet. The amenities provided us with the comfort of relaxing moments and family dining. My family and I had an amazing time!
11692633,Evan,March,2021,Great place. super clean. great location. could walk to the beach and restaurants.  good communication.
11692633,Response from Guanica,October,2020,thank you for the review. we love Rincon too. Just a short walk to beach and to nearby restaurants.
11692633,Eugene,February,2020,The location is great and the house is as advertised. We enjoyed our stay and will absolutely consider staying again next time we visit.
11692633,Kathleen,January,2020,Given the earthquakes. we were hesitant to go to Rincon. We reached out to the host who was amazing. He said he understood if we had to cancel and gave us the out up until day of arrival. He was great. The place was close to everything we love; beach. bars. shipwreck. el ancla. copa llena and a juice bar. The place had two beach chairs. a paddle board and a boogie board and the beds were comfortable. Kitchen amenities were great as well. I would rent this place again for sure.
11692633,Victor  I.,January,2020,Nice place to stay with family the house has everything as the description says. the pool is in front of the house. beach is a 2 minute walk literally. we enjoy our stay and hope to return.
11692633,Silvia,November,2019,The house is nicely located. but compared to other houses in the development it is just okay. When I was there construction was going on. so please confirm that it is done and over.

11692633,Response from Guanica,March,2017,Thanks for the review. Of course we will have you back in Feb or march!
11692633,Rebecca,July,2016,Our host communicated with us and had all that we needed to make our stay comfortable. There were beach items there for us to use.

11692633,Adnil,June,2020,The property was very close to the village and has a beach nearby. however it was not for bather. Well. it has other very close ones that are. In my personal experience. and in the face of the pandemic. the place was not clean. this disappointed me a lot since the stay was for my family and I create uncertainty if the place was disinfected and enabled to receive people. There were cockroaches and that warned me even more with all this. It had a lot of beach gear. this added value and made up for the lack of taste in cleanliness. I understand that taking the time. this shouldn't be a big issue.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
11692633,Response from Guanica,August,2017,Thank you for your review. We also love Rincon and our house.
19527619,Alex,November,2022,Its an awesome place to gather with friends or family. The pros: great view. hot water. multiple places to gather. again. the view‚Ä¶The cons: its an old place that needs some care but at least it needs to be clean. some stuff didn‚Äôt worked or existed like tvs. coffee makers and some light bulbs.Is a good place to stay with groups. just don‚Äôt have hi expectations regarding the cleanliness and some basics mentioned before.
19527619,Daniel,November,2022,Communication with host. Mishell. was really good she is very nice.  The place has a nice view and really close to the beach.   However. I can‚Äôt help to feel I was catfished here.   :(The pictures we saw on Airbnb when we booked the place are in no way accurate with the current conditions of the place.  Those colorful pool and bar/BBQ areas outside we saw on pictures are simply a non-color heavy deteriorated ara full of mold. dirt. and deteriorated wood flirting. It looks abandoned.  Not inviting at all. That only would have stopped me from booking the place as that area was the selling point for me.   The inside of building also needs some TLC.  The building has rusty and deteriorated furniture all over.   The kitchen has a broke down fridge right in the corner.    My room didn‚Äôt have a full curtain to block the light.   And there are spider webs and dust all spring the inside building along with extremely deteriorated ceiling paint.  Last but not least. we keep seeing cockroaches all over the house.   :(     Perhaps the place was an amazing place long time ago.    But right now it needs some care and renovation.   I was not expecting the Hilton. but at least a place accurate with what I booked on line and better maintained. YAgain. great location with a very attentive and very responsive host . which makes it very hard to have to write this review.    :(Show more
19527619,Jose,July,2022,"I will start out with the good. Location is excellent. and the view really is amazing. I would also add the descriptions as far as the number of rooms and bathrooms are also accurate.However. and this is a BIG WARNING for anyone looking to stay here... The pictures of this place have either been photoshopped or are from at least 10 years ago. The place has deteriorated a lot since the time those pics were taken. If you are looking for a clean place. this is probably not the spot for you. The fridges were rusty. the windows were covered in dust. a lot of the chairs were broken and in bad condition. Curtains looked old...The outside deck specially looks like nothing like the picture. I stayed away from the pool and outside area. I am going to try to post  pics in goog le reviews. so if you want a more accurate view of what the place looks like. check there. If your group is a young crowd. who just needs a place to crash at night and is not worried about cleanliness. this might the spot for you. as its very big and in a good location.... However. if you are doing a family trip and have people who need a place with standard cleanliness. you might want to look elsewhere. PS- I see reviews vary. so I feel like different people have different standards for cleanliness and upkeep... If you're staying in a place. think this looks ""rundown"". but would be ok with that. then you might be alright here.Show more"
19527619,Carla Ivelisse,July,2022,Excellent. Mishell is an excellent host üòä
19527619,Radames,July,2022,Place was great for my large family! The view was breath taking!!! Just a few concerns. Location was not easy to get to. It wasn‚Äôt an okay exact replicas of pictures taking for the few. Pool area wasn‚Äôt the safest aswell. Cleanliness wasn‚Äôt the greatest either. Building was dusty throughout all the floors in the building.
19527619,Jose,June,2022,Nice location and a perfect view to the sea (faro). The pool was very good and has a heater (an A+). The only thing recommended is that they can improve the external facilities (paint and clean the external areas).
19527619,Yessenia,May,2022,The place was spectacular. everything very organized and as mentioned in the ad.  The landlord very communicative and was pending all the time in case of any assistance.  We spent some very nice family days.  For large families 100% recommended.  :)
19527619,Jan,April,2022,A great place to be together as a family with space!  Location to the wedding was perfect!  Beaches are close by. AND THE VIEW S FROM THE DECK S  ARE SO BEAUTIFUL AND UNFORGETTABLE !!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
19527619,William,April,2022,Desecheo Inn IS everything it's cracked up to be. Huge house with three apartments. Great views. Full pool and BBQ area. Multiple balconies facing Domes Beach where you can see sunset over Desecheo  Island off the coast. All bedrooms have AC. We cooked multiple meals and the kitchen was stocked to handle them. Overall we had a great time with no issues. Mishell is a great communicator and excellent host.
19527619,Karleen,March,2022,An amazing place to stay. with the most beautiful view I ever seen. Perfect for big families. Mishell is a great Host. with a great communication! Thanks
19527619,Natalia,March,2022,Mishell‚Äôs house is amazing. it was perfect for my family and friends. it is just as described. There is enough comfortable sleeping space for a large group. location is ideal to visit all Rinc√≥n. The pool was a plus for our kids. they were in the water all the time. Outside deck and BBQ area is great for dinner/sunset. We were able to see whales from our top balcony. needless to say the view was amazing! Thank you Mishell!
19527619,Matthews,March,2022,Mishell is an amazing host. House was great for our long weekend fun. Location is perfect!! The sunset on the top deck is unbelievably amazing.
19527619,Julia,February,2022,Fantastic location that is very close to Rincon Beach.  The flexibility of several apartments to accommodate a larger group was perfect.  Loved the pool and the outdoor area. If you are planning on cooking for a larger group. should probably bring bowls. platters etc.  Very minimal pots. pans. and utensils in the kitchen. Also plan on purchasing extra TP and paper towels.
19527619,Alex,February,2022,The Desecheo Inn was the perfect place for our group of 9 to call home on our trip. Great location. great views. and plenty of space! Thanks Mishell!
19527619,Austen,January,2022,Great location. easy going and nice host. Would definitely recommend.
19527619,Brittany,January,2022,Our stay here was absolutely amazing. I came for my bachelorette with 13 of my friends and there was more than enough space to accommodate us all. The view from all of the decks is absolutely breathtaking. This is exactly the type of place I had hoped for and it really did exceed expectations. Mishell was also a fantastic host. so generous and helpful! I will be a returning customer!
19527619,Juliet,December,2021,Our family enjoyed our stay. There are many different rooms and multi-level living which allowed everyone to spread out. The pool and decks were enjoyed by all. The house has a relaxed vibe and is worn and could use some attention. but for our family it was a good fit.  It‚Äôs just a short drive to many of Rincons beaches.
19527619,Denise,November,2021,Awesome view and very spacious!! Mischell was very friendly and good host. Had a great time!!
19527619,Kimberly,November,2021,Spectacular view!! Excellent place to enjoy with the family and relax at the pool. Great location. near restaurants and El Faro the Rinc√≥n. The host is also an amazing person. very responsive and attentive with guests. We really appreciate it. You will love the view of the sunset. We will definitely like to stay again.
19527619,Valerie,October,2021,Beautiful view and very roomy. Phones don‚Äôt get service but able to use wifi. House could use a bit more TLC like a paint job. Mishell was great.
19527619,Javier,August,2021,Nice place and comfortable
19527619,Carla M.,July,2021,Overall good stay. Rented the whole building since we were having a whole family vacation (9 people) and that was perfect. We enjoyed the large kitchen and living room area on the big apartment. where we spent a lot of time as family. Same as other guests have mentioned. the building and facility really need some renovation and if it it rains hard. water can come through the wall or under balcony doors. But again. overall ok stay as the place has awesome location.  value is ok based on Rincon (expensive overall) and the pool and bbq  area is a plus! Host is very responsive and nice!
19527619,Isabel,July,2021,Great place!!!
19527619,Yahaira,July,2021,Very responsive!!! Thanks!!!
19527619,Omar,June,2021,What a great time we have at Desecheo Inn! Mishell was always available and very helpful.
19527619,Luis,June,2021,Had a great time every member of my family had there own space with bathroom and even Kitchen included. A little upgrade would help but the essentials were there. Definitely would repeat my visit!
19527619,Zajira,May,2021,Mishell is an excellent host. very friendly and with efficient communication. The building is comfortable. huge and with a beautiful view.
19527619,Tristen,May,2021,Our group of 17 had an absolutely incredible time at Mishell‚Äôs place. We could not believe the negative reviews once we were there. I guess if you are expecting the Ritz Carlton you might be disappointed but if you are expecting the perfect place to spend time with your favorite people and make memories then you will not be disappointed. All of the bedroom had plenty of AC. the common areas are large and awesome. the pool area was incredible and well kept. THE VIEW IS UNBEATABLE. Literally some of the best sunsets I‚Äôve ever seen. Mishell is also one of the best hosts I‚Äôve ever encountered. If you stay here with a group you won‚Äôt regret it. If you do regret it you must be hard to please.
19527619,Katia,May,2021,Mishell was a very good host. easy to communicate with and friendly. As far as the actual status of the house I must say that the pictures seem to have been taken a couple of years prior and although they reflect the spaces accurately the condition of the house can use an update. Towels and bed sheets can be better/newer. the house can use a fresh paint coat and some cosmetics changes would improve the look. Price was fair for all the space offered and location was on point!! The view is epic.
19527619,John,April,2021,Communication was excellent with Mishell. she‚Äôs really nice. House wise IT IS NOT THE SAME AS THE PICTURES. It looks really bad compared to the pictures. DO NOT RENT HERE UNTIL THEY UPGRADE THIS HOUSE!!!!!!! IF YOU DO YOU WILL REGRET IT LIKE I DID. I‚Äôm not a person who complains so that says a lot.
19527619,Irmarie,April,2021,nice place I loved
19527619,Wilfredo,April,2021,This place got a beautiful view.Is very closed to the beach like 5 min ride the house is huge and we love the pool.The only bad thing i have to said but wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker the house need some updating to do but we still love this place and the host was very nice.
19527619,Tyson,April,2021,Mishell was very helpful. Great spot for a larger group.
19527619,Tiffany,April,2021,The communication with Mishell was excellent prior to arriving. However. once we actually got to Desecheo Inn we were severely disappointed. The property itself is in need of significant  repairs and we had a few safety concerns. Ex.pool filtration system appeared to be missing a cover. water holding tank didn‚Äôt have a cover on it (this would have been our drinking water). steps to pool were falling apart. The bar and picnic table were rotting. The inside cleanliness needed attention as well. The coffee pot in one of the apartments was rusted and so corroded we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to use it. It definitely appeared as though the property was staged as the furniture and bedding looked of higher quality in the pictures than in person and seems as though the pictures haven‚Äôt  been updated in several years because the home even on the outside looked quite run down . While the views were incredible. we knew we wouldn‚Äôt be able to enjoy staying there with these issues.
19527619,Javier,April,2021,the place has the best view of Rincon. great for big family or group. Host was awesome. great communication.
19527619,Raul,March,2021,Place is well located near the lighthouse and beaches.  The view is outstanding and the facilities are goods.  Nice place for big families to stay.  Was a nice experience and Mishell was a great host.
19527619,Pedro,March,2021,Really nice place.plenty of spaceand beds for a big family. would stay here again. Michelle was very helpful and quick to respond to any question
19527619,Magda,February,2021,The house is really big . the pool was clean and mishell is a great person .
19527619,Lorma,January,2021,We loved our stay in this place. This house is perfect for big families that wants to keep their privacy. It has two studio and two apartments. Besides. it has an independent dining and living room. The view makes you feel relaxed. The pool area is big and you will have available a deck apart for bbq. My family and I really enjoyed our stay.
19527619,Alexander,January,2021,Mishell went above and beyond at all times. the super host star really fit her. The view is out of this world. Amazing place to stay with family and friends. will definitely be back.
19527619,Kervin,January,2021,Mishell was awesome. She made we had everything we had everything we needed. My family and I had the time of our lives. Definitely will be back soon.
19527619,Marla,January,2021,Awesome place to stay for a big family! We were always either on the BBQ/pool area or the shared living room area. The bathroom of the bottom apartment was pretty small but we just used the one upstairs (this is where sharing with family came in handy). Great price for such a big place.
19527619,Jose A.,January,2021,We had a great time at Desecheo Inn. The communication was super easy and quick. Mishell was very accommodating and very quick to respond with any questions. She was also flexible with check-in and check-out time. which was extremely helpful. The view is breathtaking! I would highly recommend staying here.if you have a big family.
19527619,Miguel M,December,2020,We had a get time! Thanks to the host very attentive. The place is perfect for a nice family vacation. Amazing views and pool.
19527619,Carolyn,July,2020,The property is set in a privileged location with exquisite view and has a most gracious host. It does need updating and I understand that there is an upcoming renovation .
19527619,Suleyman,March,2020,Mishell was a very responsive and accommodating host. The view from the stay was beautiful and the location was perfect for nearly everything our group wanted to do. Short walk to the beach. around lots of nice restaurants. and within close distance of convenience stores and supermarkets. We will definitely reach out to Mishell if we come back to PR!
19527619,Jose J.,January,2020,We enjoy our stay at Desecheo Inn. It has a very convenient location with a stunning view!! Mishell was quick to response to any message. We will definitely consider going back.
19527619,Felix,October,2019,Amazing experience in general. Everything was great. Thank you so much for this experience Mishell!
19527619,Maria Elena,July,2019,This place has so much to offer view is amazing.space is just perfect for big groups a little tricky to find (confusing) but yet had an awesome time my only criticism not exactly like the pictures colors so bright not exactly in person and be prepared for the stairs.
19527619,Carmen,June,2019,Espectacular views and lots of fun at the pool.
19527619,Iris,June,2019,Huge place with great living areas. Perfect for multi-family vacation. The common areas are very spacious and accommodate all the guests and perfect for entertaining. It doesn‚Äôt feel crammed at all. Close to beaches. restaurants. and with an amazing view. this place is great for a weekend away from the crowds and a peaceful getaway. Mishell. the host. is always nearby and a phone call away if you need her. She provides great advice on the area and suggestions on places to visit nearby.

19527619,Wildalis,May,2022,Communication with Mishel was excellent. It needs to improve interior and exterior paint of the house. maintenance and repair the wood that has rotten wood.

I would say it has one of the best views (if not the best) of the Rincon coast. The apartments were clean and tidy. As a recommendation. I would suggest that the paint  and external infrastructure be maintained more. Likewise. indicating that to enter the facilities you have to go downstairs would set a limit for those with disabilities or some physical limitations. Otherwise. I can say that my family had a great weekend in their facilities.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

41823968,Anthony,April,2022,Daniel is awesome take care of every detail
41823968,Rebecca,March,2022,Great place to stay near the beach!
41823968,Todd,February,2022,Enjoyed our stay here very much.  Accommodations were clean and well maintained.  Everything we needed was provided.  Great common areas provide opportunity to eat or relax outdoors.  We really enjoyed the hammocks on the rooftop patio.  Great location with restaurants. bars. small convenience store. and coffee shop all within a short walk.  Many beaches and surf spots nearby with Sandy Beach being a short walk away.  Only downside is while the bar/restaurant nearby serves great food and is a fun place to hang out it can be pretty loud until around 11pm.  If you're not a night owl. just close the windows and turn on the AC and you should be fine.  Daniel is a great host and will make sure you are well taken care of.  I would certainly stay here again.
41823968,Joshua,February,2022,Daniel is super friendly and responsive. Allowed early check-in. easy & ample parking. great location nearly across from Sandy Beach. Definitely recommend!
41823968,MAtthew,February,2022,Great spot! Very simple and easy living. Great rooftop hangout and pool deck!Most of all. you are steps from the sand. and a good surf spot.
41823968,Clint,January,2022,There couldn‚Äôt be a better location than this. Minutes walk to the beach. A basic convenient store next door. Easy drive to so many other bars and restaurants. The room is basic but comfortable. A/C and water worked great and the wifi too. Daniel was easy to communicate with and had everything we needed when we arrived. I will definitely return here next time I‚Äôm in Rincon.
41823968,Marines,January,2022,will return!!
41823968,Liz,January,2022,daniel‚Äôs communication. friendliness. and airbnb exceeded our expectations! he provided transportation contacts and went out of his way to be helpful. the close proximity to the beach and restaurants nearby were very convenient. we are looking forward to visiting the island again!
41823968,Frank,December,2021,Daniel was great. He was very available and very easy to work with always asking you if you needed anything would definitely recommend staying there

41823968,Jenny,July,2021,Place was simple and great for all our needs! Walking distance from the beach and since we flew in super late he was very courteous and willing to meet us for check in super late which was very considerate and kind. I will only say the power went in and out for the first few days which tends to happen in PR but generators should be able to help with that. The place was next to some cute places and shops and my friends and I loved being on the bewvh so close!
41823968,Guimary,July,2021,Excellent location. There is a mini market and a restaurant across the street from the location and the beach is a short 2-3 minute walk from the place. Beautiful and comfortable setting.
41823968,Maremi,June,2021,I will recommend the place. Daniel is en excellent host. The place is very nice. with an excellent location.
41823968,Dennis,June,2021,Daniel was a great host.  Attentive to the guest.  Location was great short walking distance to Sandy beach. plenty of food location within walking distance and easy drive to downtown central.

53725206,Rebecca,November,2022,We loved our stay at Happiness! Vero was extremely responsible and flexible with checking in and out. The unit looked just like the pictures. We enjoyed having access to the pool and patio. It is a great location for both walking and driving to nearby attractions. The bed was a little too soft for our liking. but it didn‚Äôt ruin our stay! We would definitely stay here again next time we are in town and we recommend it to future guests!
53725206,Cirse,November,2022,Not quite happiness... quasi comfortable. Most upsetting. was entering a bed with smelly bedsheets and a severely moldy pillow case. This of course. after we paid the included cleaning fee and all the while laid our heads next to an envelope on the night stand for TIPS(!). No. (But thank you Vero for coordinating a timely solution.) Mold aside. do consider the accommodations you'll have to make for the extensive house rules posted in the listing (more on entry). Note also that rations (TP. soaps) are limited; fairly so - but just barely. That said. Vero is very responsive and it's not difficult to imagine that any want for more could be reconciled. While the listing offers beach/ocean/sea views. the unit itself provides views of the pool and its mural. However. if you're nonplussed by (or else prepared for) tight regulations and strict rations. do enjoy a short walk to Sandy Beach for the promised sights. as well as jaunts to Tamboo. Big Kahuna and Casa Islena for any necessary drinks!
53725206,Laura,September,2022,Very nice place. walking distance to some restaurants and Sandy beach but be aware its not a child friendly beach.
53725206,Matthew,February,2022,The location for this place couldn't be much better! We had a great stay. Vero was very responsive and helpful. The outdoor grill works great. The apartment had everything we needed.
53725206,Alexis,January,2022,Great place. nice and clean. located just across the street from Sandy Beach. would definitely rent again!
53725206,Brian,January,2022,When I say right on the beach I mean it. Amazing location. Wonderful host. The bed is amazingly comfortable and the communal space is great for a quick dip. Grill. Hang out. Whatever your Into
53725206,Alexandra,December,2021,Veto‚Äôs place is perfect. The location is so close to the beach and the pool is so nice for when you‚Äôre unwinding from surfing and going to the beach. The apartment is designed to perfection with all amenities and small details throughly thought out and planned. We will definitely be back
53725206,Glorimar,January,2022,A tremendous location. quiet place. steps from a beautiful beach. Close to restaurants. good parking. safe place.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
51822291,Glorimar,December,2022,Hard to communicate with the host when most needed and too many contacts to reach out to. The place needs love (rusty appliances). noisy due to a construction next door but the location and view are great.
51822291,Miguel,November,2022,Not the best experience.

8495161,Prerna,March,2022,J's home is very comfortable and beautiful. and she (and Cofre!) are really welcoming. The noise from the neighbors is the only real downside. It didn't affect my 6 week stay for the most aprt. until the last week when the rooster started going off at 3am and ruined my sleep for a few days in a row. and there's really nothing that can be done about that. But overall. a wonderful experience. and I'd love to stay with J again <3
8495161,Luke,June,2021,J was an excellent host. Helpful and warm. The guest room was clean and the location was excellent. I will definitely be going back
8495161,Brendan,April,2021,Awesome spot in a quiet part of town. away from the party areas. Room was put together nicely. Great hostess!Highly enjoyed my stay.
8495161,Bradley,April,2021,J‚Äôs place is clean and comfortable. Perfect for all travelers especially a traveling surfer. Great stay!
8495161,James,April,2021,So thankful for Julia opening her house for us to stay in rincon. We had a surrogate host mk who was insightful. helpful. and caring.. plus had the cutest little fluff ball pupp. Can‚Äôt complain and I can‚Äôt see why the Airbnb could be a problem. streamlined. truthful. and priced well. Easy as and I wish the best for mk and Julia + Elise. Thankful for such a wonderful stay
8495161,Eugenia,December,2020,I initially booked Julia's place for just a few days but felt so comfortable that ended up staying the entire duration of my stay in Puerto Rico. Julia's house is very spacious. with lots of air. nicely decorated. and very clean. The Garden Oasis room is also spacious and bright. with two large windows overlooking the garden. I loved the way Julia maintained her house and hope to pick up some of the many eco and sustainable habits that she practices. I greatly appreciated living in the same house with a local: Julia was super helpful in everything and shared many local tips. She was also a great person to talk with and pleasant to spend time with! My stay at Julia's was easy. comfortable. and just awesome. Highly recommend it for the best local experience. and would definitely stay again.
8495161,Brian,February,2020,This place is great. Right up the hill from Maria‚Äôs. Parking was easy and the atmosphere was peaceful and stylish.
8495161,Paul,February,2020,Such a great comfortable space and perfect location for the area. with amenities. beaches. and breaks real close by. J was real helpful and super chill too. I would definitely stay here again!
8495161,Felix,September,2019,Julia is a great host. the place is at a very accessible location. 100% recommended
8495161,Alexa,August,2019,Beautiful. clean. simple space. Kitchen + all amenities accessible. which made it nice to prep breakfast. or lunch. Julia was responsive and helpful with recommendations for local spots. There is no AC in the space. so plan to be in a warmer space with fans - especially during the hotter summer months.  Close to everything you'd want and easy to get around with a car to surrounding beaches on the West end of the island. Close to Aguadilla airport. parking spot in the front.
8495161,Phillip,April,2019,Had a great time staying at Jbee‚Äôs place.  Jbee was super helpful and hospitable.  I had a really nice time!
8495161,Response from J,April,2019,I cried upon reading your review! Mi casa es su casa Sarah! Hope you come back and visit again soon!  xx
8495161,Yukimi,December,2018,Great location and great host. Julia is punctual and helpful in getting you to know rincon. Loved the stay here!
8495161,Maria Luisa,May,2017,We were off a main road in rincon. easy to find and directions and instructions for keys were good. Good value for price. You definitely need a car to move around rincon from Julia's place. Next door there are some roosters that sing in the morning but is kind of normal in town to hear them around. if you are sensitive with noise bring some earplugs. Bed was very comfortable and Julia provided some clean towels.Linens were clean and room temperature was nice with the fan on.  We left the surfborads outside in a little terrace as neighborhood was safe and quiet. I would recommend this place for a short stay or a vacation for one or two. Thank you Julia!
8495161,Sue,February,2017,Julia's place is in a residential neighborhood with wonderful food and coffee nearby. The room was great and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. Everything was really clean with all the amenities you could think of in the common areas.
8495161,Carolina,January,2017,Julia's place is lovely. Her dog is as sweet as her and the spot perfect for a beach get away!
8495161,Mia,January,2017,Good room! Need a car to get around. Clean and good room and apartment. Wi-fi Did not work at the hole stay. 2 km to the Sandy beach and restaurants. Highly recommend if you want to live close to Sndy beach and tamboo bar.
8495161,Susan,January,2017,You'll love staying here!
8495161,Katrina,January,2017,My friend and I rented both of Julia's rooms for 4 nights during our stay in Rincon. Her apartment is lovely! It was clean. tastefully decorated. kitchen was well-stocked and we cooked dinner a few times. the rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable(so important to me!).  The location worked really well for us as well. halfway between Sandy Beach and downtown Rincon. There were excellent places to eat a short walk away but we were thankful we had our car to get around. My favorite part of the stay was the hammock chair outside and the friendly cat that liked to snuggle with me in it. Julia was out of town when we stayed so we didn't get to meet her but she communicated everything well and we had no issues with getting in/out of the suite. Definitely recommend.
8495161,Julie,December,2016,Nice beachy feel and laidback vibe at Julia's place. Bright and peaceful room. Spacious kitchen and dining area. Central location to explore Rincon - a car is highly recommended though if you like to walk you'll be ok (just note it's uphill downhill walking). Julia was very friendly. hospitable and helpful. She knows a lot about Rincon. A great place and a great host. thanks Julia!
8495161,Alice,December,2016,Julia's place is simple. with all the necessities.You must be an early-bird to stay here as the cock is yelling starting 5AM in the courtyard stuck to the house. Good point: all utensils to cook in the kitchen !
8495161,Joel,December,2016,Julia's place is great value for surfers heading to Rincon.
8495161,Nicole,September,2016,Julia's place is awesome! it's very affordable. close to Rinc√≥n Pueblo. and very peaceful. The house and room are very clean and bright. and Julia was very kind and helpful. Her puppy. Cofre. is also a wonderful host. Would definitely stay again.
8495161,Fiona,August,2016,Julia was incredibly responsive & organized. She made staying in this lovely room a breeze. I was able to easily come & go. and the accommodations were clean. comfortable. and well-appointed. Thanks. Julia!
8495161,Andreas,July,2016,Julia is a great host! Perfect communication. responds immediately to any messages. Also very flexible about a later check out since there were no other guests arriving. The apartment is absolutely clean with a nice interior and well equipped (especially the kitchen) with everything you need. Bed is very comfortable and a  complete silent fan at ceiling makes it a good sleep. Location is good: little grocery store. a cafe. atm: 5 mins walk. The beach house is a 10 min walk. But I recommend a car for sure. Besides taxis there is no public transport and it would be a shame not to visit all the other beautiful spots in rinc√≥n like steps or domes beach (both a 5 min ride). I recommend this place!
8495161,Gina,July,2016,This was a great find. the bed is so comfortable. kitchen has everything you need. french coffee press. pots pans and lids. all the spices you'd want. there are lots of fans that cool off the house. and the location is up in the hill overlooking the water. Julia left great instructions for getting around and was really receptive to feedback. Only warning we'd like to share: there's a rooster next store that may wake you so come prepared with ear plugs! Have fun!
8495161,Michael,July,2016,great Lil spot! clean. and easy to access. host was very communicative! definitely a good place for a surfer feel and close to the ocean.
8495161,Stefanie,July,2016,Though we never me Julia she was very easy to communicate with and gave us some great ideas of things to do and places to see and eat. Her apartment was in a good location and easy to find. The oasis room was beautifully decorated and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we would need for cooking. We also enjoyed meeting the guests who were staying in the other room and even went snorkeling with them. Wish we could have stayed longer. Thanks Julia!
8495161,Karinna,July,2016,Juuulia!! Thank you so much for having us! Your house is adorable!! And next time i would go there again!! Thanks you
8495161,Tiffany,June,2016,The room was very welcoming and comfortable. Emails provided by Julia were in depth and provided plenty of options for places to visit during our stay. The home was located a short driving distance from the water and restaurants.
8495161,Morgan,June,2016,Had a great time at Garden Oasis. Our host. Julia. was very friendly and accommodating and the place was in a great location for its price! Would definitely recommend to a friend looking to get the full Rincon feel.
8495161,Lissbeth,June,2016,The stay was excellent. It is the first time I use the application.  Excellent facilities. clean. safe. accessible to arrive.   I recommend it 100%; Julia was very polite. respectful. generous.
8495161,Arelis,May,2016,Julia is a very great host. She is very approachable and friendly. The place is quiet. clean and it's easily accessible. Also. is cozy and breezy. We had a great experience during our stay. Highly recommended.
8495161,Colleen,May,2016,Julia was a great host. who was super helpful about giving local recommendations for food. drinks. things to do. etc. She responded quickly to all my questions. and was really flexible about being available for when we arrived. The room and house are accurately described. and in a great location. Super great weekend - plus her dog is cool too :)
8495161,Alicia,May,2016,This was my boyfriend and I's first experience with Airbnb and we couldn't have asked for better. Julia was quick to respond when we decided to book last minute. Once we arrived she showed us genuine hospitality. The place was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was immaculate! Anything we needed plus some. was provided! The place was super close to a few good restaurants and not far from the town of Rincon. She can give you great recommendations for local activities and things to do! Thanks for the great experience Julia. we highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay near Rincon!
8495161,Tachie,April,2016,The place it was exactly as describe it. The host Julia was awesome. very polite and makes u feel like home.The place has the best ubication near the best beaches. places to eat and night time. The place is very quiet and peaceful. Hope to comeback soon...
8495161,Shannon,April,2016,Such a great experience living here for two weeks! The house was nice and clean. bed was comfortable and the place was in a great location! There is a cute bakery 2 minutes away (walking) and the beach was about a 10 minute walk. Julia was very sweet and promptly and thoroughly answered all my questions prior to arriving. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Puntas Rincon! I will definitely be back :)
8495161,Mandie,March,2016,Our stay in Rincon was absolutely amazing.  We stayed in the Garden Oasis room for 12 days.  We did not see our host as she was out of town bit was still very reachable and still very helpful.  Julia is an awesome host even from far away.  She gives tons of information on EVERYTHING you need to know about not only Rincon but Puerto Rico in general.  The location is awesome. but we did a lot of walking.  We were used to it by the end but for the faint of heart it may be a bit challenging.  There was a couple staying in the other room that were super nice and we hung out several times with them throughout the duration of the trip. They were a little more successful with hitching rides to and from the beaches than we were so we mainly walked everywhere.  It was an awesome stay!  Some notes to prepare yourself though (not a negative at all just a buyer be aware)... we had a lengthy stay so no washer was semi inconvenient for that long. however. we washed clothes in a bucket and hung to dry outside (I only say this because different people may not like that.  I did though).  Also. kitchen is large but not a lot of cooking equipment (plenty of dishware but only one two burner stove top. though most nights we coordinated well with the other couple there were a few times one of us was waiting for the other to finish cooking.  As long as you're cool and laid back though it was a perfect little spot!  We loved it! Thanks Julia! Hope to see you the next time! Show more
8495161,Verena,February,2016,Julia's place offered great ambiance and lots of space. She's one of the best hosts you can find providing lots of information about the island. She made us feel at home from the very first moment onwards. You've got to love it!
8495161,Jessica,January,2016,No surprises which was great. Everything was as expected. Clean house. comfortable space. easy to find. Julia. the host. was there the whole time. and was super friendly.
8495161,Riana,December,2015,Julia was very communicative. It is a tad difficult finding the apartment without using her directions. so follow her directions exactly as she wrote them and you'll be fine.   She provides a very detailed description of things you can do while your in the area. Ex: food. places to go. things to do.   Her home is very clean. spacious. and exactly as pictured. The bed is very comfortable after a long day of sightseeing.   The bathroom is clean. With regards to the water heater. once again follow her directions. At first I couldn't get it to work and the water was cold. my husband fidgeted with it and it worked perfectly and the water was much warmer.   We had a great time and enjoyed the place. We would've stayed an extra night. but we already had plans for accommodation in another city.   *If you're a light sleeper. the neighbors have a rooster that crows early in the morning. I grew up around that so it didn't bother us.Show more
8495161,Nicole,December,2015,We loved the apartment! Our room and the entire apartment was spacious and cool and had plenty of natural light. We shared the apartment for one of the nights we stayed. which was totally fine given how spacious the apartment was. Our room had a lock and our belongings were totally secure. The kitchen was completely equipped with a huge fridge. utensils and some basic cooking supplies. and the bathroom had plenty of towels and even shampoo and soap were provided.
8495161,Claudia,December,2015,Great!  Julia communicated thoroughly and gave great info about place!  Very helpful.   Place worked out great!
8495161,Karolina,November,2015,Beautiful place and great location!The room and whole apartment are very clean. spacious and comfortable. Big plus for avocado tree:) Thank you Julia!

23729869,Denise,July,2022,Great place! Second floor of rest ‚ÄúEl Despecho‚Äù (you must eat there. delicious food and great mojitos).
23729869,Jossette,June,2022,Great location for walking through the plaza of Rinc√≥n. However. the apartment was not clean upon arrival (much dustiness and dirtiness). Although an efficient location. before booking. I would keep in mind that the plaza is noisy all day and night. and finding parking is not an easy task. If your goal is a small place to only sleep in. great.! If you want a more of a relax experience. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
23729869,Jose M.,May,2022,Excellent location!
23729869,Chris,May,2022,This apartment is in a great location! In the very center of Rincon and within walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars. the beds were comfortable but the apartment wasn't the cleanest. and the only shower periodically stopped draining. which required waiting 5-10 minutes before it started to drain again.
23729869,Tamara,May,2022,Sarah's place is in the perfect location. We walked to everything and it was great for our older kids to walk to eat or get snacks. The balcony was great to eat out and just chill.  The beds were very comfortable and the rooms stayed very nice with the AC.  Definitely one of our favorite stays in PR!
23729869,Jose M.,February,2022,Excellent location and price. Will be back for sure.
23729869,Don,February,2022,La Casita at the Plaza. is a great spot if you want to be at the center of the action in Rincon! You have everything you will need (Including the beach) within walking distance. The place is located behind Vatos Locos Taco Bar. just off of the plaza. The outdoor patio space will smell like taco meat during the day due to the close proximity of the exhaust fans from the restaurant. this bothered some more than others. Another thing to note is that since you are close to the plaza and all of the action there is road noise from traffic that may bother a light sleeper. As someone who lives on a busy city road back home it wasn't an issue for me.Overall it's a good spot conveniently located in the best part of town. I thought it was a great deal for the price.
23729869,Cole,January,2022,Wonderful patio balcony and a pull-up bar haha. Can walk to a multitude of restaurants and bars. Clean and pretty. We were thankful we stayed here
23729869,Olivia,January,2022,Sara is great! She gave great recommendations before my stay and made sure to stay in communication if I needed any help or suggestions! The place is great and in a perfect location!
23729869,Janet,December,2021,Great location. Lots to do within walking distance.
23729869,Javier,November,2021,Execellent location.  Plenty of restaurants around and a lot to do around.
23729869,Tony,October,2021,Perfect for a weekend getaway. Close to many restaurants and shops. as well as walking distance to the beach. Enjoyed our stay.
23729869,Samuel,July,2021,Perfect apartment right near the plaza of downtown Rincon. The bedrooms get nice and cold with the AC. and there‚Äôs a nice little balcony for sitting. chilling. and enjoying your morning coffee or evening mojito. My friend and I had a great time. Would stay there again! Also. check out the restaurant right below. They serve delicious Puerto Rican food. The owners are so friendly and told us we get a free drink because we are staying at Sara‚Äôs place.
23729869,Ricardo,July,2021,This is a beautiful 2 bedroom apartment with a great location. We never used the car. we parked in front of the apartment and walked to restaurants. bakery. pharmacy. beach. shopping. party. beer factory. deserts. coffee.We really appreciate this place.Thanks Sara
23729869,Graham,June,2021,Nice little apartment in downtown Rincon. Walk to everything. My favorite part was the outdoor patio for lounging.
23729869,Toni,June,2021,Sara was great; gave many recommendations and communication was quick and easy.
23729869,Noah,April,2021,Sara was really a wonderful host. Place was clean and ready to go when we got there. Very close to everything you need in Rinc√≥n. Located behind the local taco place is convenient but be wary if you can‚Äôt handle the smell of restaurant cooking as the outside porch is right next to exhaust fans. We stayed for a month and it was perfect. Thanks so much.
23729869,Amy,April,2021,The proximity is awesome to local bars and restaurants. It was very clean. There are steep steps to carry your luggage up though so beware of that. You may have to walk a block for parking on the street. Extra towels and sheets/pillows would have been a bit more helpful. But overall. it was a great place to stay!
23729869,William,April,2021,Great place to stay in Rinc√≥n
23729869,Mary,March,2021,A very comfortable apartment right in the heart of the city! Just what we needed for a few days to explore the area. We enjoyed snorkeling and surfing. and then visiting our favorite panaderia on the square every day for lunch. The tips from Sara were really helpful. we absolutely loved the Thursday Night Art Walk. Thanks for a great stay Sara!
23729869,Zoe,March,2021,Thank you Sarah for all of the amazing insider travel tips! The taco place next door. wow. If you‚Äôre looking for a downtown Rincon stay to lay your head after a day of play. great place.
23729869,Jennifer,March,2021,Love this place ‚ô•Ô∏è great location
23729869,Cassidy,March,2021,Perfect spot to enjoy downtown Rincon!
23729869,Samantha,March,2021,If you want to be right in the loud plaza area of Rincon. this is a decent. lesser expensive place to stay.  If you want a place to crash. 2 bedrooms. 3 beds. with a small kitchen - it will suit your needs.  If you plan to be out and about most of the time. even better.  If you have a car. make sure you drive around a bit to find safe parking - the roads are tight.  It's cute and well-located around plenty of food options.  Right now. PR has a curfew where restaurants can't serve food after a certain point so if you make a reservation somewhere for dinner or put your name in. make sure you have a backup plan in case it's getting close to curfew.  Additionally. car services won't be available past a certain time either.  Good info to have before traveling.There was construction on the floor below and workers in the backyard throughout our stay. so you might want to check with the host about the times of day that might be happening before deciding if this will work for you. For some. it might not really matter.The apartment's outdoor terrace area was a little difficult to enjoy due to the neighboring restaurant's fan blasting onto it. I wish we'd been able to sit out there more.We did have some issues once we arrived with things not working and unfortunately. we were on a tight schedule. and dealing with these issues did affect the rest of our evening's plans which was a disappointing start to the stay.  Our stay was made better by having a quick way to get out to the various beaches around town. and Rincon's thursday evening Art Walk event around the corner which we highly recommend attending.Show more
23729869,Dulce,February,2021,The place does have the beds offered and a couch to sleep in too. It was also clean. However. the experience of getting there. lack of communication from host. as well as horrible attention was awful. I‚Äôve been to many places and this has been my worse experience. The host sent me an automated response as a welcome. and half of the information was wrong! Including how to get there. landmarks to find the place (she said there was a restaurant with a completely different name. which was about 12 minutes AWAY from the actual place). The WIFI information provided was also incorrect and the place didn‚Äôt allow to use AC. otherwise I‚Äôd be charged an extra 125$. Sara was a nice person but whoever Rachel is. was not. She was very rude because we had lack of communication and even though lack of communication was both ways. she didn‚Äôt provide any kindness or curtesy. Honestly. if you‚Äôre looking for a calm place to stay. this is not it. There‚Äôs also a lot of noise on the busy street. so if you‚Äôre not used to it. it‚Äôll be hard to sleep.
23729869,Lynette M,February,2021,Right next to the town plaza. exactly what we wanted. The apartment is quaint. with two large and comfortable  bedrooms. The beach is just a five minute walk past local food and drink businesses. A definite next stay is in the horizon.
23729869,Shane,February,2021,Excellent location. but parking is a little tricky. Apartment is not the address that is given. GPS will take you to the front of the taco restaurant. but the place is on the street off the Main Street directly behind the restaurant. Clear directions came after I messaged host. Big bed has a very comfortable mattress.
23729869,Ely,February,2021,Really cool place!! Perfect location. Close to everyting from very good  restaurants. to great beaches. We enjoyed every moment!!!
23729869,Geisha,January,2021,Beautiful location. very lovable and cute town. wonderful views and very cool lively night life on Saturdays...
23729869,,MayraJanuary,2021,Great place. close to the beach and food establishments. the apartment was cozy. I'll be back soon
23729869,Robert,December,2020,Full kitchen items.  Lockbox checkin. One bathroom located in larger room.  No A/c in kitchen area.
23729869,Joe,December,2020,Great location! Seconds from Downtown Rincon and all it has to offer. Rooms have great space.
23729869,Ionica-Corina,November,2020,Location is a dream...right in the main plaza. few minutes from the beach. extremely convenient!
23729869,Stephanie,October,2020,Great location. easy access. Wonderful rooftop.
23729869,Rafael,July,2020,Sara was an amazing host. She was very understanding and everything was exactly how it looks.
23729869,Lisa,July,2020,Sara's place was the perfect spot to crash between beach days. It was very clean and tidy. I particularly enjoyed my hot water shower after a long day at the beach. Right in the Rincon Plaza where you can walk and get anything you need. including delicious Friends coffee. Easy to find and great communication with host.
23729869,Karen,July,2020,Perfect place to stay at Rincon. Everything was close to La Casita and we had an amazing time.
23729869,Josue,June,2020,Excellent location close to everything you need restaurants. stores. and pharmacy etc. If you are looking for an authentic Puertorican town experience this is your place. Sarah is an excellent host that will take care of everything diligently. Thanks
23729869,Francis,June,2020,Sara‚Äôs place location is everything! In the middle of the plaza. steps away from the coffee shops and the farmer‚Äôs market! Very cute place and safe! Highly recommended!
23729869,Jose A,March,2020,If you want to stay in real town this is the place. Really near the restaurants Very close to the square. Little bit noisy but this is the town. Definitely I'm back.
23729869,Brian,January,2020,Perfect place if you want to be downtown Rincon and have easy accessibility to downtown. It is about a half block away from the main street with easy walking access to stores and restaurants. Beds were extremely comfortable. It definitely had a Puerto Rico town center feel.
23729869,Victor,December,2019,Sara's place was perfect for our family. It has a Queen bed in one  bedroom and two separate twin beds in a second bedroom. This floorplan was perfect for traveling with two grown sons. Overall. the unit was spacious and very clean. The location was perfect also; we were on a side street just a minute or two from the main square in downtown Rincon. We highly recommend Sara's place!
23729869,Jeff,July,2019,Very cozy place with excellent outdoor patio with an incredible location right next to many shops and restaurants.
23729869,Katherine,May,2019,Loved it!
23729869,Tiffany,March,2019,This place is awesome. I could not have had a better stay! Check in is simple with the lock box. hosts have a ton of local tips for activities. beaches. food. etc. that were emailed to me upon booking. The place was in a central location downtown- I parked the car and walked most places save for a few beaches I wanted to explore. Super clean and a modern feel. Came with water. beer. coffee! The balcony/patio was huge and relaxing- a shady place to enjoy coffee. or on one of our afternoons. to watch the rain. Shower was hot. spacious layout with three big comfortable beds. a kitchen. and living room. I'd love to go back!
23729869,Alejandro,February,2019,Just perfect
23729869,Steven,February,2019,Great place
23729869,Auridelie,January,2019,Need to improve the cleaning in the property.
23729869,Leigh,January,2019,We had a lovely stay at Sara‚Äôs property. Easy check-in/checkout. amazing communication and local tips from the host and fantastic location/proximity to the plaza and Thursday night Art Walk! The kitchen is closer to a kitchenette. so plan for smaller/simpler meals at home. (Though there is a single pan induction heater for cooking!) All in all. a very nice stay. Thank you!
23729869,Peter,December,2018,Great host!
23729869,Sheila,December,2018,The place is in an excellent spot.
23729869,Skye,November,2018,Great location in Rincon.Walkable to everything.Easy communication.Beach towels to use.Everything is smooth staying here.
23729869,Vilma,October,2018,Nice place for a short trip. I definitely will return.
23729869,Carol,August,2018,Location. location. location! Very walkable and quiet place. Linens were sparkling clean. Sara sent us an amazing email before our check in with tons of suggestions and that was super helpful. Rincon is a cute town with beautiful beaches around. Totally worth it for people who don't plan on spending a lot of time indoors.
23729869,George,August,2018,Ok place. The bathroom in one of the bedroom makes sharing with friends impossible. Door in bathroom won't close. Very noisy at night.
23729869,Leroy,July,2018,Excelent place. very comfortable and clean. Sara is always available for my questions. Definitely stay again!!
23729869,Loren,July,2018,What a great place! Sara was a fantastic host and the location was phenomenal.

23729869,Pepe,July,2018,Very nice location. walking distance from nice restaurants and the town's Plaza. Air conditioners were A+. Sara was very responsive and available all times. Highly recomended for a 1 to 2 nights stay.
23729869,Benjamin,July,2018,Beautiful apartment with a great location. we had a great time here and had everything we needed.
23729869,Melissa,July,2018,The casita was cute. clean. and very spacious. Everything you need for a comfortable stay and more. It is small-kid friendly. The Smart TV was a big hit for them. Great AC units in the rooms. Sara was a great host. Responded quickly and accommodated our request.
23729869,Zachary,July,2018,Great stay! Super easy to get in and out. on our own schedule. Sara was always available for quick responses to questions. Plenty of space. and great proximity. as advertised. I'll be back!
23729869,Jaclyn,June,2018,Goodness. Sara. You were one of the best hosts with all your tips and links and google maps. We went to almost all of the links you provided. Spanish ruins. 4X4ing. Wilderness beach. Kaplash restaurant. Maria beach domes beach. Horse back riding. Rincon Art walk. We also rested at home comfortably. Clean sheets and towels! Thank you sooo much for being so responsive and so involved. You are amazing!!! Highly recommend!
23729869,Shawn,June,2018,Really great location! It is walking distance to many places and events (we loved the farmer's market). As Sara notes. the neighborhood noise is pretty loud throughout the night but with the air conditioning on it was manageable. There is a nice little rooftop terrace that we enjoyed sitting on. Sara was also very helpful with local recommendations and tips. Our teenage girls did a surfing lesson with some one she had recommended and it was a huge success!
23729869,Naihomie,May,2018,Very clean and well located place
23729869,Nichole,April,2018,Amazing location. great amenities and super helpful information from Sara - would recommend!
23729869,Geoff,April,2018,Nice spot with a nice patio. close to the square.
23729869,Molly,April,2018,Very quaint. The deck space is fantastic.
23729869,Corinne,April,2018,Sara was so helpful for our trip. even when we had to change our dates. Don‚Äôt forget to read the whole posting; she explains it well. It was fun to spend time in the center of Rinc√≥n at a place that could fit all our friends.
23729869,Nicole,March,2018,Sara's home is right in the heart of it all. Right behind one of our favorite bars and walking distance to everything you need.
23729869,Emma,March,2018,This place is too expensive for what it is . 50 per person is an outrage especially when almost everywhere places offer air conditioners for less. The shower was gross . plus no hot water.we checked out as soon as we checked in. I asked her to refund me part of my money and didn't get a response. Parking is really hard to find too. I wouldn't pay more the 80 dollars a night . no matter how many people stay.

23729869,Lorena,June,2021,If you have no problem with being looking for parking well away from the property. this place may be for you. It is located in the same village of Rincon and therefore it is very difficult to get parking. It is just behind a restaurant and the kitchen exhaust fan points directly to the apartment so all that hot air smells like food through the terrace towards the living room/kitchen. It's not nice in that regard. And be prepared to bathe in COLD water because it doesn't have hot water. The rooms are comfortable and have well functioning wifi.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

33346086,Jessica,February,2021,Truly a hidden gem off the winding mountain roads of Rinc√≥n. Modern and newly renovated villa with private access/parking space.  Perfect for winding down after partying. surfing. and exploring!
33346086,Scott,February,2021,The grounds of the gated property are beautiful with the view of the ocean behind and the attention to detail in the villas were excellent. Check-in was a breeze and we even extended our stay for a night :)
33346086,Karla,February,2021,Lovely stay!
33346086,Kendyl,January,2021,We had such a great time on our honeymoon and really couldn‚Äôt have stayed at a better place! I‚Äôve stayed in a few places in Rincon and this one is definitely in our top 3. I loved how we were in villas around other people! It felt like a cool community. Everyone was so nice! Even with the curfew. we had a blast and enjoyed every second of it. It was a great place to come back to after everything closed at 8:45pm. They had great suggestions as well!
33346086,Julian,November,2020,Fantastic stay. Super clean. Amazing location. Hosts super responsive. When I come back to rincon will try to stay again! Also great with the security gate as well as code for apartment so no need for keys

33346086,German,June,2020,Very nice place. Will come back again.
33346086,Doel,February,2020,Lions Gate is our go to when visiting Rincon. If you want to be close to everything and yet find peace here is were you need to stay. 100% recommended!!
33346086,Lindsay,January,2020,Lions Gate Villas are an absolute gem. Our expectations were exceeded by the  charm. cleanliness and space provided in these newly built casitas.  The kitchen has a microwave. gas range and a full size refrigerator and freezer and we cooked breakfast many days to get to the beach sooner! The bathroom is roomy and private with a great shower and a nice big drawer under the sink to store your toiletries.  The location is perfect. Up the hill from the beach and a great beach front restaurant called Tamboo. you are close to everything including all the beaches and the cute downtown of Rincon. The property grounds are stunning. you can tell Annette and her husband put a lot of thought and love into beautifully manicuring the grounds with beautiful flowers and plants. The views are beautiful as well. John was wonderful at communication and so kind and patient promptly answering my many questions!   We can't wait to return to this magical place!
33346086,Marcos,December,2019,This property....WOW! Gated entrance. a short drive (I mean. like 3-5 minutes) to everywhere you want to be. incredible views. and Annette and John are amazing hosts.The property is new and they have put in all the touches (keyless entry. remote control fans and A/C. etc.).  We cannot wait to stay there again!
33346086,Eduardo,September,2019,El apartamento es espectacular y limpio. cerca de todo pero a la misma vez en un lugar privado fuera de la carretera. The apartment is nice and clean. The location of the suites is great. Hosts responded promptly to messages and were very attentive. I will definitely book this place again. Thanks
33346086,Waleska,July,2019,"Excellent experience! They made us feel that they take care of us. in terms of security. privacy and amenities included. There was a power outage and we didn't realize it because they have an electric plant and water tank. The cleanliness is impeccable. the ""casita"" has everything you need for your stay and also have a washer and dryer service. The design and decoration details make the visitor feel at home. also includes soap and towels. as well as kitchen utensils. coffee maker and dishes. Annette and John are always very attentive and answer any request immediately. We will definitely repeat the stay very soon! Recommended 100%"

2492502,Troy,July,2022,Richard is one of the best host we have encountered during our stay in Puerto Rico. The unit we stayed in was very clean and well stocked with everything we needed. We even asked for a blanket and he brought two blankets and two more pillows. The views from here are the best sunsets in Rincon. We watched the sunset from the pool the first night we stayed and it was the best. His units are very close to town. so if you need anything its a few minutes away.  Will stay again when in Rincon.
2492502,Mariela,April,2022,Nice place with everything that I need.
2492502,Kris,February,2022,Dope place the views and location were amazing . the room was really nice and clean when we checked in BUT found a mice in our room that ate half our food few days after . breakfast was advertised with the stay but the host said it wasn‚Äôt happening anymore . wifi barely worked inside the room the entire stay and the directions should be very detailed before the person has to check in because there‚Äôs almost NO cellular signal in that area . Just an honest review this place has a lot of potential but needs improvement .
2492502,Elba,January,2022,A  very quiet place with a beautiful view and a peaceful vibe.  Richard is very kind and respectful
2492502,Thannia,August,2021,Really nice view. Accesible to the beach. restaurants and bars. Really cold AC.
2492502,Kailey,August,2021,Musty. No blanket given. only a top sheet. No bathmat for showering. Wish I booked elsewhere.
2492502,Jancarlos,August,2021,This place is awesome! If you‚Äôre looking for a place to relax and enjoy the sunset you should consider this Airbnb 100% !
2492502,Maria,July,2021,This was a great rental. The unit was clean and comfortable. Richard and Lorenzo were awesome. made us feel welcomed. Thanks you both!
2492502,Charles,July,2021,A great place to stay. WiFi was pretty good. ACs worked well. The view is amazing for sunsets. Would definitely stay again.
2492502,Luz,July,2021,Good hospitality and attention. Well clean.
2492502,Maria,June,2021,Richard‚Äôs place is close to everything (beautiful beaches. places to eat and magnificent mountains and trees. You can enjoy quiet mornings and beautiful sunsets from your balcony. The place was spotless. the bed was nice and comfortable. and each unit is private. Another nice treat is that on weekends you get served continental breakfast on the main floor.Lorenzo. the caretaker is attentive. understanding. compassionate. friendly and joyful. It was a wonderful addition to the hospitality offered by Richard. We hope to get back there soon! However. be very careful driving up and down the hill. as there is a curve and locals drive recklessly.
2492502,Elba,May,2021,Great ocean view and location. Close to beaches and restaurants. Richard and his staff are very nice. Highly recommended.
2492502,Adrian,February,2021,Richard was kind and eager to help when I had any questions. I loved the outdoor spaces. enjoyed the view. and appreciated that there were few mosquitoes at this location. so I was able to work and exercise on the patio comfortably. The view was great and I appreciated that the room and bathroom were really clean. Other reviews had me worried that the kitchen would be worse than it was. but it wasn't bad. I think replacing a couple of older / worn out items (like the dish rack / stopper / sponge) would make all the difference.I was notified after I checked-in that the wifi doesn't work so well in the studio I booked. which  was problematic at times mid-day if I couldn't find enough shade or had to join a video call after dark. Other than that. really nice space and would recommend for a short-term stay!
2492502,Response from Richard M,January,2021,Thank you
2492502,Jose,November,2020,OK option for a very last minute booking.
2492502,Isa,October,2020,Super clean. priceless view . easy going friendly host
2492502,Alex,October,2020,Pretty nice and cozy place. Awesome sunset view. Love it. Only thing is the parking space is scary. Overall. everything is perfect. Looking forward for another weekend.
2492502,Melissa,April,2019,I'ts a good place to stay.
2492502,Susan,January,2019,Richards place was far beyond our expectations. Beautiful view. spacious room and wonderful hospitality
2492502,Response from Richard M,January,2019,Thank you
2492502,Response from Richard M,May,2018,Rincon Puerto Rico is country here they still have horses and cows. Also bugs
2492502,Ezequiel,April,2018,Excelente view
2492502,Gabriel,January,2018,Nice place. close to restaurants and night life. The ocean view is brutal and the place peaceful. Will stay again for sure
2492502,Enrique,July,2017,Very good view
2492502,Arturo,July,2017,Centric. near Rincon's nightlife.
2492502,Jossette,March,2017,Good experience! Excellent and beautiful view from Richard's place. Richard is very nice. he also waited for us until very late on Friday night. Thanks for everything. Good luck!
2492502,Justin,January,2017,Great place
2492502,Nicholas,January,2017,Richard was a brilliant host from the start. When we first arrived to Rincon we had trouble finding the place and he drove to meet us in the middle of town. The sunrise / sunset views from the room and balcony were unforgettable. Richard was always available with any help or questions. My girlfriend and I are very excited for our next stay with Richard at casa vista del mar!
2492502,Rebecca,August,2016,Richard was great at accommodating us last minute and was very nice.
2492502,Myriam,July,2016,Good location. comfortable room. Richard was attentive.
2492502,Angel,July,2016,Richard's place was quiet with a great view. He was very accomodating and even drove out to meet me downtown as I was somewhat lost. He is a great host and would definitely stay here again!
2492502,Radhames,July,2016,Richie is a great person and the room is fantastic.
2492502,Rob,April,2016,Richard was great. Very flexible. My wife an I were exploring the west coast of PR and ended up in Rincon. It was late and we needed a place. Richard was available and his place was great. as expected. The views were awesome. We just needed one night but would have stayed at least one more but we were off to another adventure.
2492502,Christian,April,2016,This place was great! It was secluded enough to be relaxing and calm. but at the same time it was close to everything you need in Rinc√≥n. Dining. nightlife. and all the best beaches.
2492502,Jose,March,2016,Everything was perfect. great location and Richard was very accommodating to our needs.
2492502,Richard,March,2016,The views are amazing and Richard is very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely come back again.
2492502,Leah,March,2016,Richard was a very friendly and outgoing host. The studio was sufficiently equipped with a kitchen and balcony and of course an outstanding view. A communal porch with a grill was great for home cooking. This is a great place to stay if you'd like to get out of the congested coastal part of Rincon. but still only a few minutes drive to the water. restaurants etc. Being a little inland provides a cooler. breezier experience for sure.   Drawback: Wifi was clearly advertised in the listing but did not work at all in the room. Smart TV also didn't work. because...no wifi...
2492502,Brayton,February,2016,Richard was very friendly and made my first Airbnb experience a very pleasant and an easy one. Our flight was over booked. we desperately needed a place to stay and we here was this listing to our rescue. The place was just as described. beautiful view up on top of the hill. Far enough away to feel secluded but just coast down the road to find yourself near shops/restaurants/beach access. Next time I visit. this place and Richard will be top of my list!
2492502,Kathleen,February,2016,Beautiful views from the balcony. and kitchen in room made this apartment just what we were looking for.  It is less than half a mile to the market.   Checking in was easy with manager on site.   Issues with TV and Internet were resolved by manager.
2492502,Response from Richard M,February,2016,Thank you for coming and for your suggestions sorry I missed you I had to take care of some medical issues I hope to see you when you come back  to get married the best of luck to you Jasmine who was there didn't want to disturb you again I'll see you when you come back thank youShow more
2492502,Drew,February,2016,Richard lives in a quiet neighborhood about 1/2 mile to the beach. and away from noise and traffic. He was a great host who called while I was enroute to make sure I was okay and to see if I needed any help.
2492502,Pea,January,2016,Richard is a naturally warm-hearted man with a very good sense of humor.  The place is no frills. but you get hot water. a comfortable bed. and a great view.
2492502,Rich,September,2015,The listing was everything he said it was and more!! The location and view are awesome and the place is near all the great local spots to have a drink and a good time!!
2492502,Katia,June,2015,This is a beautiful. quiet place to come and relax. Richard guided us to find the place without a problem and made us feel welcome. The rooms are spacious. clean. comfortable. and with a great view. What you see in the pictures is exactly what you get. We loved this place and look forward to visiting again in the future!
2492502,Alejandro,May,2015,Richard was a great host! Great place to stay and what a view. It's situated in a great hill. Awesome!
2492502,Christine,April,2015,This was a great place!
2492502,Derek,March,2015,Casa vista del Mar was the perfect hilltop getaway from the hustle and bustle of Rincon town life. while still being a short 2 minute drive away from the town and beaches.  Richard allowed us to use the grill and huge patio as much as we wanted. and the views from the bedroom were absolutely amazing.  All in all a great stay and I would recommend it to couples looking for a nice getaway.
2492502,Jose,February,2015,Great view. Great host.
2492502,Gabriel,February,2015,Very nice rooms with great views and balconies. The place is very well taken care off compared to other places in Rincon.
2492502,Steve,February,2015,Richard was not in. but Jasmine filled in well for him getting us set up.  We really enjoyed the view - an excellent sunset over the ocean our first night.  Sitting on the porch overlooking town was great for the evening relaxing and morning getting going.  A great kitchen area made breakfast easy to get ready. but we were too caught up in the beaches for other meals.  We were just a 500m up a hill from town and then it was a mile to the town beach. The street we were on did not have a sign - it is the one at the Rincon Inn and Sherwinn Williams paints off the main drag.
2492502,Isabel,February,2015,Gorgeous views from this casa. The balcony is well worth every penny. A mango tree in the driveway dropped edible gems. It's away from the bustle of town. but only a few minutes to food. beaches. and world class snorkeling. It was clean and comfortable. the basics were all there. We couldn't get the direct tv to work. but there was a DVD of the Hobbit. so we watched a little of that. The only noise was frogs and birds. Very relaxing. I've seen better bathrooms. but it did have hot water. :) we would stay again.
2492502,Response from Richard M,February,2015,Forgive me for your experience I wish you would've let me known these things while you were here so I could have seen them and checked them out for myself enjoy the rest of your trip . Rincon is a big place but a small town keep smilingShow more
2492502,Shirley,January,2015,This is a nice property. Clean. great water pressure. Very peaceful; just what we were looking for during this weekend getaway. Beautiful view of the ocean. Especially appreciated the plush bath towels and fully equipped kitchen-there was even a cork screw and a potato peeler! We had stopped to buy soap for our sensitive skin and lo and behold. our host had already placed the same exact brand in our room! It was a nice surprise. Thanks Richard!
2492502,Jingqi,January,2015,I arrived there very late because I hit my car with a rock and fixed it somewhere else. But Ritchie waited for me there. When I stayed there. the view is really amazing and u can enjoyed the natures in balcony. The room is very clean and comfort. However. though the location is a little hard to find. it is worth a try to live there for vacation!
2492502,Miri,December,2014,Richard was very helpful with direction ( we got lost). I came here with my mom and we both loved it. The view was amazing!!! We would definitely come back. But you really need a car round this area.
2492502,Daniel,December,2014,It was great at Richard's place. everything better than we expect it. Great town to surf or snorkel and beautiful sunsets! We had everything we needed in the room so we cooked there every evening. he has a nice grill on the terrace too!
2492502,Pamela,November,2014,We loved Richard's place. It was exactly like the pictures! Richard was out of town but he arranged for someone to meet us to give us the keys. I only wish we had more time to stay in Rincon because we really enjoyed it there :)
2492502,Stacey,November,2014,The place was very nice. Comfortable and clean with a gorgeous view and balcony. Located in a quiet safe neighborhood up the mountain. Not far from town at all!
2492502,Ana,September,2014,Great location with a gorgeous view. The room had the basics. a full side bed. TV. small fridge and stove.  It has small balcony with two chairs to have the morning coffe with a beautiful view of the ocean. The bathroom is clean. The fridge had some fruit. milk. eggs. butter and beagles for a light breakfast. Richard is a very nice person and helpful. It was a good deal for the price.
2492502,Marcia,April,2014,location was great and the porch had a great view. our room had a mini fridge that was filled with some stuff for a light breakfast the first morning which was nice. Richard was polite and helpful and for 70 dollars a night we felt it was a good deal.

2492502,Kelian,July,2021,Excellent place to disconnect from everything for a few days. We loved the location because you could see the sea in the background by day from the balcony but at the same time feel nature (bird trees etc.) and at night listen to coquis and feel fresh air and peace. We were safe in the place and had a great time. Good point to note is that everything was close by. Thank you to the host for the opportunity to stay.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

39835596,Duncan,March,2022,A perfect hideaway for the single traveller. All that it needs to be with everything a short (but steep) walk. A wonderful host who accommodates and provides any help needed.
39835596,Gregg,February,2022,The room itself is not the point. It's pretty simple. But it's the beautiful garden-like setting. And the view of the sea as you're coming down the hill. And the lovely farideh. And the hottest shower you will ever take. I could have stayed there forever...
39835596,Jack,February,2022,Great spot close to marias and domes. Perfect for a one person surf stay.
39835596,Laura,January,2022,This all-in-one room is in a lovely residential neighborhood with a great view. It was perfect access to Rincon Surf School the next street over. a quick 5 minute walk. Farideh is a gracious host who is very easy to reach. I would absolutely stay here again.
39835596,Mason,December,2021,Farideh is very responsive and the value is commensurate with the pricing
39835596,Catherine,July,2021,Good place to crash
39835596,Rodolfo,June,2021,Very nice. peaceful and quiet place. Pleasant stay.
39835596,Justin,May,2021,Farideh‚Äôs home is a wonderful stay. This unit in particular would only be suitable for a single person. However. it was a great option. Farideh keeps her property very lovingly curated with a diverse plant life. It is a little slice of heaven. sitting on the patio - or in apartment with screen door - and enjoying the sun and afternoon showers. Further from town. Best to have a car. and still beach and a couple great spots to eat in walking distance.
39835596,Joseph,May,2021,Beautiful apartment. lovely hostess. among such an amazing garden. Couldn‚Äôt be happier! The only drawback is that you should definitely have a car. I love to walk everywhere and did but it is about 15 min to beach. an hour walk to town. Worth the walk to get the fish tacos at Rinc√≥n Brewery maybe the best I‚Äôve had
39835596,Brandon,April,2021,Amazing property located near anything you could want to do! The room was incredibly clean. the host was above-and-beyond with accommodations. and the property is in a very safe and comfortable area. I maximized my stay by taking short walks each day to the vast amount of local restaurants in the area each day -- which is exactly what I was looking for. Blocks away from the perfect coffee shop to work/study in. blocks away from 'The Beach House' for sunset dinners. and blocks away from 3 amazing beaches. It is an amazing property offering wifi. views. and the comfort of a home -- the owner even gave me some freshly-grown tomatoes before heading out. Loved my time here and would absolutely return to stay in the future if I were in the area!! 10/10.
39835596,Holly,March,2021,I booked this stay for my brother in Rincon. He says Farideh's place is beautiful. and she is a kind. attentive and responsive host! Thank you. Farideh!
39835596,Bar,February,2020,Great quiet location !! Nice clear view! Will be back ü§ôüèªü§ôüèª

9859004,Mark,December,2022,The central location and the great rooftop are the main attractions here.  Our party of eight could  walk in any direction in about 10 or 15 minutes to get to the beach and/ or get good coffee. sandwiches. beers. pizza. breakfast burritos. pretty much anything.  The rooftop is exactly as it is shown. wonderful views. and a great gathering place for everybody in the mornings for breakfast and coffees. or in the evenings to eat dinner. and/or play games. or just to lie around and read a book.  Owners were very responsive for the few minor items we had. and for good recommendations as well.
9859004,Daniel,April,2022,Great host!! Property as described. super clean. convenient. great communication. It was perfect for my family on three different apartments on the same property.
9859004,Eileen,December,2021,The Boarding House is in a terrific location near all the surfing beaches. Vanessa was extremely helpful and answered all our questions. The rooftop view was spectacular and we enjoyed many fun times with our family up there. We even had a couple of barbecues!
9859004,Sarah,November,2021,Great location - easy to get to different beaches in Puntas or in town yet quiet enough to hear the coqui frogs during evenings on the rooftop. And the ocean views from all three suites plus the rooftop were amazing!  We loved the little touches of comfort - hammock on the roof. comfy pillows. well-stocked kitchen. and easy place to rinse our gear and clean off sand from the beach.  We took full advantage of the beach accessories for the whole family - chairs. snorkeling gear. sand bucket. etc. Friendly hosts are super responsive and helpful!
9859004,Meagan,July,2021,Our group of friends had a wonderful time at The Boarding House. It was the perfect layout for both privacy and socializing on the roof deck. The views are unbeatable.
9859004,Dorliska,July,2019,The place is just as described. actually. better. Loved! The apartments have everything needed and mora. Vanessa and Lola were lovely hostesses.
9859004,Sofia,July,2018,Vanessa was the perfect host!!! Very caring and attentive. even left us coffee out every morning. Our group of 10 has a blast. The view from the rooftop is AMAZING and the premises and rooms are extremely comfortable. Furthermore. Vanessa provided us with a bunch of information for activities which helped make our experience and stay even more awesome! Definitely two thumbs up and five stars... this is La Tribu's top choice for a Rincon getaway!
9859004,Gerald,January,2017,Vaneesa was a great help. met us at arrival . had great insights in the area and was extremely gracious

9901290,Response from Peter,July,2022,Thank you so much for choosing to stay with us again. Tiffany!  It was great to have you and your family back and we are so happy that you liked our upgrades for the furniture. beds and decor. especially the outdoor shower (that‚Äôs my favorite!).  Hope to have you stay with us again!Show more
9901290,David,February,2022,Peter was an excellent and responsive host and the house was as advertised.  It's in a great location just up the hill from the center of town. in a quieter area with lots of easy parking.  The wifi was strong and allowed a few of us to work from the dining table easily. though we didn't test whether it's strength would carry to the back bedrooms.  While the area was really quiet. sound also traveled so on our first few nights we were awakened by roosters crowing very early in the morning.  Some in the group just got used to it awhile others opted to use a white noise soundtrack on their iphones to deal with it so it wasn't an issue overall.  Some of the stuff on the inside isn't the newest (the towels/blankets are somewhat worn but fine. some of the chairs and kitchen stuff similarly). but I understand some of the furniture and other stuff is in the process of being updated so it may be new for your stay (indeed. one of the couches in the living room was brand new for our stay!).  Overall it didn't really bother us though and the house was great value.  Would definitely recommend!
9901290,Francis,January,2022,Awesome house minutes away from the beach and amazing restaurants. We had a lovely stay and the swell came as soon as we arrived. Highly recommend
9901290,Thomas,September,2021,Very clean and comfortable home in a nice and fairly quiet neighborhood.  Well equipped small kitchen.  small but comfy living area. nice dining table.  No cable.  but who needs it. You could always stream onto the TV IF you bring the right cable (HDMI).  We stayed in the off season. and you will need to keep the louvered metal windows closed.  This retains AC but did nothing to block or reduce outside noise.
9901290,Glisedia,August,2021,Loved our stay! The place is spacious and comfortable. Peter is an amazing host- very easy to communicate with and very welcoming. The location cannot be beat- so close to the beautiful downtown area in a secure and quaint little street- close to so many amazing beaches. We would definitely come back!
9901290,Antonio,July,2021,This cozy home is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Within walking distance you can easily get to gift shops. bakeries. a pharmacy. and great restaurants to enjoy from breakfast to dinner and drink a great coffee at Kaf√© Terra. You can also walk to Lala beach  and the markets Sunday morning. The home has everything needed to spend an amazing and relaxing time. Across the street from the house there is a basketball court where you can play with the neighbors basketball and volleyball and have fun at the swings as well.
9901290,Tiffany,July,2021,Wow. what a great family oriented house. This house is very ideal for families. Each family member and I had a bed which made us feel comfortable. Heads up. the beds are very low but again we used them to sleep only. We did have a problem with one of the beds. we immediately reached out to Peter and he responded quickly! There is no cable but again we weren't in the house much and the wifi was great! Check-in was super smooth and easy. The outside hose was a plus when coming back from the beach as well as having a parking spot in the driveway. We did have a day where the power was going off and on but nothing to be worried about. The house comes with beach chairs and an umbrella that came in handy when visiting other beaches. The house is super close to town and we do recommend going to Econo to get water jugs and food. I would definitely recommend this house for families.
9901290,Jeffrey,June,2021,Happy with our stay.  very nice home and couldn't ask for better communication.   Location very handy and a nice neighborhood.
9901290,Marcus,May,2021,The house is amazing!..Having no cable but the option to watch classic films and i must say the DVD and VHS catalog is amazing. The video game system with Guitar hero was pretty cool. It felt pretty good staying in a house with just wifi and no cable. The rooms are perfect! The house looks small but when you walk in everything is so spacious. The neighborhood is full of kind people. The house is also in an awesome location close to the downtown area as well as the beach! You can walk it if wanted. The late night walks were amazing especially on how peaceful the town is. Such an amazing house in a perfect location to create those ever lasting magical memories.
9901290,Alex,May,2021,Great place. easy check in
9901290,Response from Peter,April,2021,Nate.I am glad to hear that you were happy with the house but very sorry that you felt the hospitality lacked. To be fair and honest. each bed is supplied with a blanket and bed sheets. No blankets were missing.  As your message to me stated. you felt they were too thin and asked for 2 replacements.  Too thin implies lack of warmth which is why I simply suggested to try turning down the ac at night while I tried to find  replacement blankets for you.  Also. you brought this to my attention after 4 days into your 6 night stay.   As our listing clearly states. we are a ‚ÄúSurf Bungalow‚Äù and are priced accordingly. The beds and furniture are Ikea. which may be perceived by some as cheap. but they are sturdy.  Again. this is the first time a blanket issue has been brought up. which my previous reviews can attest to. and being in the Caribbean during the high season a thin blanket has never been a problem.  However. I am happy for the feedback and will take it all into consideration. Again. I do appreciate you spending your vacation with us. Regards.PeterShow more
9901290,Riva,April,2021,Peter's bungalow is very cute and comfortable for our family of four. The kids enjoyed movie night courtesy of the big selection of old school DVDs/VHS tapes! We were all grateful for use of a washer and dryer. and a full kitchen to make our own meals when we felt like staying in. We had a great time in Rincon. and this very nice place to retreat at the end of a tough day of beach and sun was a big part of it. I highly recommend!
9901290,Evan,March,2021,Peter's house is big. clean and in a nice/quiet neighbor.  Close enough to where you want to be. but not in the middle of the ruckus.  Peter was super prompt with all communication and just a nice guy.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.
9901290,Devin,March,2021,Peter is a good guy - very responsive and knowledgeable about the area. The house is a great location and has everything you need!
9901290,Alfonso,December,2020,Loved staying at this place. If you are looking for a relaxing place to spend some time and maybe do some water sports. look no further.
9901290,Timothy,March,2019,Cozy. comfy. quiet place to stay and relax in between outdoor exploring adventures in Rinc√≥n! Everything was clean. the house has a very comfortable. inviting ambiance in a quiet neighborhood and is complete with air conditioning in each room. ps2 with tons of movies and games. great location that is walking distance from the center of town. A great value and great place to stay!
9901290,Response from Peter,January,2019,Hey. Ian. thanks for the kind review!  So happy you enjoyed your stay and our home. it was a pleasure to host you!!  Come back anytime. you've got a home in Rincon!!
9901290,Nancy,August,2018,Peter's home is a few blocks from the main plaza in Rinc√≥n - an easy walk minutes to a lovely little beach town with restaurants. shops. photo opps. The bungalow is as lovely and charming as it appears at his site. It had everything one would need in accommodations. and then some. Was clean and thoughtfully appointed with things to do while unplugged - our family had an especially wonderful time. It's near lovely beaches. surrounded by friendly neighbors. safe. and comfortable. Highest ratings for this special vacation getaway. (We'll be back!)
9901290,William,July,2018,Great place!!! Thanks Peter
9901290,Javier,April,2018,Pros: Extra clean house. near to downtown. quiet neighborhood.Cons: electronics need an upgrade. no wifi
9901290,Sean,March,2018,I can‚Äôt recommend this house enough. it was the perfect accommodation for a group in Rincon. We were traveling PR and had to find last minute accommodation in Rincon. and Peter was very receptive and helpful even with such a short notice. He gave great tips about the area and things to do. The house itself is amazing. Definitely bigger on the inside. the pictures here don‚Äôt do it justice. All the rooms are stylish and comfortable. and big enough to accommodate a group. The house is located just a few minute walk from the center of town. but is also uphill enough to feel secluded. At end of the day. it felt like we returned home to OUR home. and not just a vacation rental. Would recommend this house and experience to anybody.
9901290,Janine,August,2017,Our stay was awesome!! This house is so cute and cozy (as described). It was perfect for us. Peter was so accommodating and any question I had he would answer right away. The house is in a great location in Rincon. not far from anything. Everything was right around the corner. either bakery or grocery store. souvenir shops and beaches!! This was my first time in PR and I love it and this house made me feel like I lived there and was coming home to my house everyday. The place was clean and the air conditioning was nice and cold especially with how hot it was outside. There's even little toiletries in the closet like shampoo and conditioner which came in handy the last few days. The only thing they didn't have that would've come in handy was an ironing board. it was a little difficult having to iron my clothes on the bed (but by no means did that ruin my trip lol). We will definitely be returning to PR and will definitely stay here when we come back. Thank you Peter!!
9901290,Arthur,April,2017,Peter's place is in the perfect location just up the hill from the beach. Many restaurants and bars are within a short walk.  The house itself is very clean both inside and out. One thing we really enjoyed were the very quiet air conditioning on the hot nights. Everything we needed was there for our long term stay. The house has beautiful terrazzo floor throughout. which made cleaning very easy.  I would recommend this house for both short and long term stays.  Myself and 2 others were staying here for business and Peter was very friendly and accommodating to our needs. You will not be disappointed by this house. location. or host.Thanks for everything Peter! Hope to stay with you again.
9901290,Brett,August,2016,This place was awesome!! I stayed here with four other friends and there was plenty of space for all of us. The house is even cuter in person. and more spacious than the pictures convey. It had everything we needed and more. The location was perfect - a cozy. quiet neighborhood just a five minute walk from the center of town. The beach was also within walking distance - we didn't rent a car. so that was definitely a plus. Peter was a great host. too. Super quick to communicate and provided a ton of helpful information about the house. as well as a list of things to see/do in the area.   If you come to Rincon. stay here!!
9901290,Kiimberly,July,2020,The accommodation is spectacular. the lighthouse and the spa are very close. In addition. everything you need is inside the accommodation. Love the place and the experience.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

22527001,Rafael,July,2022,Amazing location and property. A real magical getaway. The host was super nice and the apartment was beautiful. Thank you so much for the experience!! Highly recommended
22527001,Tammy,May,2022,The place was beautiful. I loved sitting outside in the early morning watching the sun rise. Hearing all the animals in nature while looking at the beach. Small yet perfect. I would highly recommend.
22527001,Brian,April,2022,Lovely spot in the hills near Rincon. A short drive to town and several wonderful beaches. If you're a solo traveler or couple looking for a quiet spot that's not a hotel or resort. Farideh's apartment fits the bill.
22527001,Victoria,March,2022,We share a huge THANK YOU to our host. Farideh. to welcoming us with such warm arms. The spot was perfect and equipped with all things for a low key escape. Everyday we woke up in pure bliss and gratitude. forever grateful and looking forward to our next stay! Thank you kindly ‚úåüèæüíó
22527001,Bernard,March,2022,Farideh is a wonderful host who really cares. She keeps her place clean and the grounds are just beautiful. My favorite space was the foliage-covered canopy back patio surrounded by lush colorful greenery. The town is eclectic and has spectacular trails and beaches. I will visit again. Thank You Farideh
22527001,Jordan,March,2022,Farideh has a beautifully designed home on a quiet street in the heart of Rinc√≥n that makes you feel like you are living in the rainforest. It has all the thoughtful touches for both surfers and non-surfers. My favorite part was the back deck which had a canopy of leaves over a table so you could work outside with shade. Farideh is wonderful herself and very responsive and flexible. You‚Äôd be lucky to get this AirBnB!
22527001,Valerie,February,2022,The most wonderful Airbnb ! Will definitely be back :)
22527001,John,February,2022,10/10 would recommend. Farideh and her home are amazing I plan to stay here again next time I‚Äôm in Rincon.
22527001,Janet,February,2022,A magically home set in a gorgeous garden. Farideh is a super host who went out of her way to make us feel at home. Every day I woke up to birds and chirping frogs. The place includes everything you need. even the most delicious papaya and fresh herbs for cooking. I highly recommend Farideh's home for a memorable vacation in paradise.
22527001,Simon,January,2022,Farideh went out of her way to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The Puntas Garden Apartments are set in the lush green hills of Rincon. with amazing 180 degree views of the ocean. The apartment it‚Äôs self is clean very comfortable. and full of character - reflecting Farideh‚Äôs great taste and artistic talent. We will definitely return and highly recommend for guests who are seeking a special place in the sun with real character.
22527001,Niclas,January,2022,Would highly recommend staying with Farideh. Lovely space in a flourishing garden with two sunny terraces. Location is on top of the hill. so a rental car is recommended. Farideh has been very welcoming and helpful with any inquiries we had.
22527001,Suzette,December,2021,Beautiful place to relax and enjoy some time off!! Specially enjoyed the beautiful garden area and outdoor decks. The studio has all the essentials and its peaceful and relaxing surroundings are amazing if you are looking to enjoy nature. Farifeh is a great host. super nice and accessible. Would higy recommend to friends and family!!!
22527001,Christine,November,2021,Excellent. charming space in Rincon to stay near everything worth eating and seeing and doing. but away from the noise and bustle of town. The garden is beautiful and peaceful. and ocean views on the street are stunning ! Hospitable and kind host. We will be returning for sure.
22527001,Yesenia,October,2021,We had a great time. quiet and peaceful place. Very clean and beautiful. Surrounded by lush vegetation is perfect for a weekend getaway.
22527001,Raymond,September,2021,Great location to stay with a beautiful outdoor area. Very quiet and relaxing.
22527001,Devin,August,2021,Wonderful gem in Rincon! Would recommend to anyone who wants to experience Rincon. Farideh was very helpful and her place was wonderful! Stunning work spaces for anyone who wants to sit outside bd enjoy the two patio areas. Loved it!
22527001,Brian,July,2021,What a gem! The photos here do not do this place justice: The building is surrounded by lush. beautifully landscaped gardens. with two terraces to pick from depending on where the sun is in the sky. The space is large. spacious. gracious. and only 15 minutes to dreamy Sandy Beach by foot (5 by car). Farideh charmed us with her opinionated (and excellent) restaurant recommendations. and by brining us guacamole freshly made of avocados from the garden. We loved our stay here.
22527001,Ruben,July,2021,This place is amazing. very cozy. clean and accessible to many areas in Rinc√≥n. Some other reviews mention the need of a car. but that is true in all PR. Beaches and restaurants are less tha. 2 miles away. the place is very quiet. clean and beatiful. I will stay anytime in the future.
22527001,Kelly,May,2021,Farideh‚Äôs property is beautiful. She was very helpful and welcoming. the space was clean and comfortable and the shower is amazing. Great location. walkable to sandy beach. So much fun!
22527001,Michael,April,2021,This place is extremely dated with no much around. Good luck getting around without a vehicle. Host is responsive but failed to mention the apartments true amenities.
22527001,Rachael,April,2021,We had a lovely stay at Farideh‚Äôs place. The apartment was spacious and clean. It had everything we needed for a few beach/surfing days (aloe vera in the bathroom for the inevitable sunburn). The view from the terrace was excellent and it was a peaceful place to drink coffee and watch the wildlife. The location was a quick drive from the beaches. the grocery store. and restaurants. Highly recommend!
22527001,Mar√≠a,April,2021,Love love love. would definitely stay again
22527001,Hannah,March,2021,I think this may be one of my most favorite Airbnb experiences to date. We don't need much when we travel -- just a nice. clean place to lay our head. but we found ourselves wanting to stay and enjoy this little oasis. The views and gardens were spectacular and we already miss waking up to our morning coffee views. Farideh was very responsive as well and offered suggestions around the area for us to visit. She was a wonderful host and this is definitely a place we will stay again when visiting our beloved Rincon. Thank you for the hospitality. Farideh!
22527001,Erica,March,2021,Farideh was a gracious host and always responded very quickly to questions. The apartment was wonderful and the back deck was incredible! I loved waking up there every morning. Highly recommended!
22527001,Justin,February,2021,Loved the location!  It has a special charm. where it feels like a European chateau surrounded by Tropical vegetation overlooking a lush green valley.   Killer outdoor spaces perfect for coffee or a glass of wine at sunset.
22527001,Zaira,February,2021,This apartment is lovely!Cozy. so airy... a lovely studio/garden apartment!You can walk to through the garden (barefoot).  You sleep with doors wide open (it's safe!).At night you can lay down on the deck and enjoy the stars. wonderful!
22527001,Cristina,February,2021,Great location. Very quiet and relaxing. Very comfortable. Farideh was quick to provide anything we needed and always had a kind greeting. It felt like a second home. Strongly recommend.
22527001,Elvin,February,2021,We had an amazing weekend with Farideh. The place is very private and romantic. Its has a beautiful view. the apartment decoration was beautiful. and we have everything we need. Farideh was an amazing host.  We hope to be back soon.
22527001,Levi,January,2021,My wife and I loved our stay here! It was very cozy and romantic. Everything was clean. the kitchen and bathroom had everything we needed. and we loved having breakfast out on the patio. The location was perfect to feel secluded yet a quick drive in to town and to the beaches.
22527001,Fritz,January,2021,Farideh is an amazing host. She's extremely responsive and even picked fresh papaya and star fruit from the garden for me. Apt A is a quiet oasis for a solo trip to recharge or couples get away.
22527001,Kip,November,2020,Farideh‚Äôs place is a hidden gem. We had such a romantic getaway. Clean. private. gorgeous views. We enjoyed amazing home cooked meals in the garden. The room was super cozy and cool. The shower had amazing pressure. Overall. we had such a nice stay. We will certainly be back!
22527001,Ankit,November,2020,Farideh‚Äôs place is very nice for one or two people with great amenities and just what you need for the perfect stay in Rincon. The photos for the location are slightly different although that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing - the apartment has a fantastic shower instead of a bath and there are two outdoor areas which are really nice for starting your day with a cup of coffee. There was one minor issue with Farideh‚Äôs apartment - the first couple days we saw a few bugs but after we contacted Farideh about it she happily sprayed the place and we did not encounter bugs after that. Another note - Farideh‚Äôs place is great if you have a car as all the beaches are a very short drive away. Sandy beach. the closest beach. is a 4 minute drive but a 20 minute walk. Overall. I would highly recommend staying at Farideh‚Äôs apartment!
22527001,Liliana,July,2020,Lovely place! Surrounded by plants. breezy. quiet. and relaxing. Very private and close to everything. Farideh was great and very helpfull. I didn't want to leave!
22527001,Rolando,July,2020,Great host and location! The place is very quiet. The apartment is perfect for couples or one person. We can wait to got back! ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è

22527001,Gabriel,March,2020,For a single or a couple. this is a beautiful quiet space where you can relax. Location is perfect.
22527001,Natalie,February,2020,We had an amazing time! The place was gorgeous and Farideh was very kind to us and let us check in early.
22527001,Olesya,January,2020,Everything was just perfect! The house itself is very cosy and stylish. me and my husband enjoyed every minute staying there. We‚Äôve been to many many places and Farideh‚Äôs house is one of the best we‚Äôve been to so far. You will feel that vibes inside :) The location and surrounding area is awesome. Farideh. thank you very much for you hospitality and kindness. We will definitely come back one day!:)
22527001,Jeffrey,December,2019,Great location near sandy beach with back porch area. Farideh is very helpful.
22527001,Marilian,July,2019,Great host. very responsive! Nice and quiet if you are looking for that. Not to far from beaches and town.
22527001,Ariella,March,2019,Farideh's place is nice. but definitely not stellar. It was at least 20 minutes walk to the beach. and the place was old but was clean for the most part. It was really hard to find at night. Farideh was nice and responsive to messages.
22527001,Michael,March,2019,Farideh‚Äôs garden apartment is spacious and peaceful with two private patios (one with a scenic view). The apartment is close to several beautiful beaches‚Äîone that is within walking distance. Farideh was responsive. welcoming. and kind. and we enjoyed chatting with her during our five night stay in Rincon. I highly recommend Farideh‚Äôs place if you‚Äôre looking for a clean. comfortable. and peaceful spot to stay near beautiful beaches.
22527001,Elizabeth,March,2019,Farideh is a gracious hostess. My friend and I had a few travel problems which she was quick to help with. and beyond what is expected of an AirBnB owner.  The space was decorated beautifully. with amazing landscaping and great location. Thank-you so much Farideh. It was an absolute delight.
22527001,David,February,2019,This location is stunning.  The views are wonderful and you feel very close to the sky and the ocean at the same time.  The apt. was exceptionally clean with a great shower which I always really appreciate.  Comfortable bed and a very open airy feeling to the whole apartment. Farideh was very communicative and quick to respond to our requests.  We look forward to a return visit someday!
22527001,Sydney,February,2019,I cannot say enough  wonderful things about farideh‚Äôs homeIt was beautiful . quiet and perfectly locatedWe can‚Äôt wait to go back
22527001,Dan,January,2019,The unit is charming. accented with artwork that the owner painted herself.  It's a welcoming and comfortable place to stay.

22527001,Mary,June,2018,This is a delightful hideaway. 15-20 minutes walk from Sandy Beach. and a few minutes drive from great snorkeling.  The garden is beautiful. and we spent a lot of time on the patio. enjoying the lush surroundings. Farideh is a wonderful host. and gave us great tips for our visit. We loved our stay in Rincon!
22527001,Rafael,April,2018,Quaint!
22527001,Kelly & Chris,March,2018,Fraideh's little gem on the hill is a breezy. quiet. meticulously landscaped oasis that feels like its miles from anywhere. while still being central to everything. A perfectly placed outdoor porch with gorgeous ocean views. is the perfect place to have coffee in the morning. or dinner under a blanket of stars with the sound of waves crashing in the distance. It's evident. by the attention to detail in her garden and home. that this artist loves her lush little spot in paradise. and will do anything to make sure that you do too.
22527001,Adriana,March,2018,This place is exactly what my boyfriend and I were looking for. it really added to our experience in Rincon. Great views from the kitchen. bathroom and backyard as well as the front of the apartment. Communication was never a problem! Farideh was very helpful and attentive. Love love love this place.

48886759,Dominick,December,2022,What a wonderful place. It‚Äôs way more spacious than what‚Äôs shown in the pictures. The three bedrooms are huge and two of them have dedicated bathrooms.  The place is very new. It was spotless. I would have given it seven stars. if possible. The hosts were incredibly responsive. I don‚Äôt think a message went more than five minutes without a response. They were incredible. The beach is a five minute walk. The restaurants are a 10-15 minute walk. Being next door to cafe2go is a huge plus. The breakfast trailer across the street was amazing. The pool and the outdoor shower are awesome!!! That‚Äôs a huge difference maker. I‚Äôm an early riser and it worked for me. But. to be honest. if you are a late sleeper. be prepared to hear loud vehicles between 7am and 10am. It‚Äôs located at a fairly busy intersection but i didn‚Äôt care.  I loved it. I will be back!!Show moreResponse from GilbertoJanuary 2023Excellent guests. thank you very much for choosing us!

48886759,Daisy,July,2021,The house was perfect for our family trip. We were a group of 11. we bought an airbed and were able to fit comfortably. The house is clean and updated. the best part is that is walking distance to the Plaza of Rincon. The plaza has lots of restaurants. bars. and even a beer garden. The location is also walking distance to the beach. and other beaches are a short drive. and it has a great coffee shop next door.. A food truck parks across the street with the best sliders. The host was super nice and always available. I will love to go back and stay in this house.

5859458,Kathy,July,2022,I loved everything about Ross‚Äô place! I booked it for three nights while my parents and I were in town for a wedding. Ross‚Äô instructions for check in were thorough and he dropped a pin in case we had trouble finding the place. We used Waze to get there with no issues. You cannot beat the view from the balcony. Will definitely stay here again when I come back! Thank you
5859458,Vivian,July,2022,Lots of room. very comfortable. Symphony of bird/frog sounds in evening. Ross gave us helpful beach suggestions.
5859458,Xiu,July,2022,Great place that is of very good value. Roosters are loud. Otherwise it was a great stay. Away from town!
5859458,Adam,July,2022,Ross's place is very comfortable and clean. Nice view too. I had a very good experience here.
5859458,Alyson,July,2022,Great space‚Äî secure spot close to that‚Äôs easy and fast to get to the beach and attractions! Highly recommend.

5859458,Viviana,June,2022,Very nice stay with an awesome view!
5859458,Julie,March,2022,Spacious. spotlessly clean space in the midst of nature. banana and plantain trees. roosters. ducks. cows. horses and lots of coqui frogs. Especially loved the back balcony in the early AM and at night.
5859458,Michael,March,2022,Great time. Great location
5859458,Naveen Shankar,March,2022,Ross communicated really quickly about my query about internet speeds ( i take a lot of zoom calls).  I am so glad I picked this spot. He also offered to help us when my car got a flat. gave excellent recommendations for sunset. and was just an excellent host. Totally recommend!
5859458,Wendy,February,2022,We had to cancel. due to a flight change. and Ross was considerate and generous and allowed us to do so
5859458,David,February,2022,we will be coming back!

5859458,Geoffrey,January,2022,I've traveled to Rincon multiple times over the last few years to surf. reset my head. and remember what's important in life. Usually I stay at a place and burrow away to do my thing. But why not get into the fold a bit. take advantage of what's great about a locale. and discover some lovely local favorites? I made a great choice staying at Ross's. The place was clean and roomy with a bed room for me and my buddy. The kitchen ample. the couch and TV great for evening phase out. and the back deck the perfect spot for morning sun. big view. and inspiration. Ross anticipated my needs. hooking up a generator before I could ask. when all of Rincon lost power due to grid upgrades in the district. I ran zoom calls all day just perfect. When I asked for a cooler for an evening beach hang. it was in front of my door within 2 minutes. I left refreshed and alive. ready for the hard cold life of NYC. Grateful for my stay at this well valued location with great folks who can show you the way. Cheers!
5859458,Kyle,January,2022,Incredible spot with great views in a great location. Ross was real helpful with things to do.
5859458,Yibing,December,2021,Very clean apartment with two large bedrooms! Convenient location to all the beaches. The ocean view from the balcony was amazing!
5859458,Jihan,November,2021,Ross place is very clean and has great value! It's close to the beach and downtown (only 10 minutes) But make sure you bring the noise cancelling headphone if you  have poor sleeping quality. At the first night. I failed to fall asleep until 5pm due to rooster keeps crowing every 30 minutes. On the next two days. I took sleep aid with noise cancelling headphone which helped a lot.
5859458,Albert,November,2021,Ross and his family are terrific hosts. he really made me feel very welcome.  The place is very roomy and has everything you need to relax and be comfortable in a breathtaking jungle hillside.  The patio is a perfect little spot in the back of the unit with views all the way down the hill and to the coast. complete with a hammock!  Parking out front is a breeze.  I'd love to stay there again - and highly recommend to anyone considering it.
5859458,Luis,October,2021,Excellent place to stay.  Good space and localization. Ross received us on a last minute booking and it was a great choice.
5859458,Ella,September,2021,This was an amazing place to stay! 10 out of 10 would recommend. The space was great. clean. unique. and beautiful. Had a gorgeous view of the jungle from the balcony and you could even see the ocean on the horizon. Ross and his wife were able to help us significantly with our last minute booking and overall we‚Äôre very accommodating. We especially loved their guide book of Rinc√≥n!
5859458,Adela,September,2021,Beautiful and spacious place! The view is also fantastic and we enjoyed the liveliness in the surrounding areas. The town that is 5min away at night is very fun and great for morning breakfast. Would recommend and stay again!
5859458,Claire,August,2021,Great location. and great hosts. It had a lot of things I didn‚Äôt expect including our own beach towels provided by the owners. The views are what I loved best. Just sitting on the hammock during a storm took my breath away.
5859458,Milagros,August,2021,A perfect place to relax and have a wonderful vacation. you have everything you need . The location is close to everything. Very comfortable beds. living space and garden. We look forward to returning.
5859458,Julie,July,2021,Ross‚Äôs place was comfortable and located in a quiet neighborhood in beautiful Rincon. While we didn‚Äôt get a chance to meet him in person. Ross was very easy to get in touch with and was very accommodating. Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice. low-key stay.
5859458,Melissa,July,2021,Ross' place was more than pleasant.  It was spacious. clean and had everything we needed during our stay.  The messages/instructions provided prior to our arrival were clear and accurate.  We enjoyed being so close to nature (palm trees. pana and mango trees and the birds singing) We would wake up in with the crowing of the roosters and ended our day with the sound of the coquis. It was very relaxing! Can't wait to go back!
5859458,Olivia,June,2021,My favorite place I stayed in Puerto Rico by far. Modern touches. great amenities. great views. great hosts. This place had everything we needed for a comfortable stay and then some. Tons of places to sit and relax (indoor and out). and a convenient outdoor rinse-off station for sandy feet before going back inside! We can't wait to come back :)
5859458,Eric,May,2021,Such an amazing place away from home.  The house was spacious and clean.  From the modern design to the breathtaking views it‚Äôs everything you could ask for.
5859458,Tiffany,May,2021,This is one of my favorite Airbnb's that I've ever stayed in. The apartment is very spacious and beautifully decorated. It's good for couples. a family or a group of friends. The vintage bedding and the random closet jeweled knobs were my favorites. The kitchen is FULLY stocked with utensils and all appliances. This neighborhood was awesome because there's a 24 hour gas station (for milk. cereal. junk food. water. etc.) and a liquor store across the street (which has coffee and WINE). Also. the pizza place closeby serves some of the best pizza ever. Ross and his family were so nice - I wish we could have stayed longer. I can't recommend this place more.
5859458,Tian,May,2021,Spotless clean house in the mountain. Has great view of trees. horses and...maybe it was a snake that i saw?üòç Ross waited for our late check-in. very considerate. Prepare your own drinking water though. also check the Guest Guidr Book on the table for correct Wifi Password.
5859458,Felicia,May,2021,Such a cute property with all the nature sounds and views. Ross was super accommodating. friendly. and showed us around the property before giving us our privacy. WiFi was really fast and reliable and the home was well stocked. 10/10 would stay again!

5859458,Serena,February,2021,Very spacious apt. great views. host very friendly and easy to get in touch with. who provided helpful local tips! Would definitely recommend.
5859458,Inna,February,2021,We really enjoyed our two night stay at this large beautiful house with fantastic views. The host met us and helped with the check in. as we arrived late in the evening. The casa is located at the top of the hill so the views are amazing. with a ~7 minute drive to the nearest beach. Lots of farm animals around (not seen. but you can hear them from time to time). with roosters. cows and others. which was great for the away-from-the-city experience.
5859458,Ariana,February,2021,Ross and his family were sent from heaven to provide you paradise on Earth. Had everything we wanted and more. don‚Äôt look any further.  book this spot. just do it.

There is a nice balcony with a view of a lush valley and the ocean in the distance. The place was very clean and also bigger than I expected. Ross was super nice and gave us helpful tips on beaches. restaurants. grocery stores. etc. We don't surf. but he could definitely tell you where the good surf spots are. He responded immediately to the few questions we had and then just left us alone for the rest of our stay. which is perfect. I'll stay here again next time I make it to Rincon.

5859458,Alec,March,2019,Absolutely beautiful views and wonderful place. Got to grill on the back porch one night and lay out in the hammock. Ross gave us awesome tips on where to find good surf! Totally recommend. this place was great.
5859458,Carol,February,2019,This is a great option for 4 guests. Very well equipped and close to everything.
5859458,Daniel,February,2019,Great stay. Ross and Koren were everything you could ask for in AirBnB hosts. and then some. The pictures on the website do not do the place justice - it is super spacious and very clean. Will definitely be back!
5859458,,MayraFebruary,2019,The place is really nice and clean. Just like the pictures. I will definetively recommend it to a friend. Only inconvenient was the dogs and roosters from neighbors but i can live with that.
5859458,,MayraFebruary,2019,it is a very clean place and neat. Everything is as pictures. If I ever come to Rincon this is my place to stay.
5859458,Evgeny,January,2019,Amaizing place. the host is super-nice! 2 cute dogs to play with)
5859458,Tim,January,2019,We had an amazing stay for our honeymoon and first time in Puerto Rico with very helpful and accommodating hosts! The home is well appointed. tasteful and spacious. The best feature is their back patio - breathtaking views accompany unbridled relaxation. We spent our mornings and nights out there. New Years was a blast as we felt we had the best observation deck for the surrounding firework shows. The surrounding attractions and restaurants that are available to enjoy home are easily accessible from the home. This experience couldn't have been better and we look toward coming back!
5859458,Tim,December,2018,We had an amazing stay for our honeymoon and first time in Puerto Rico with very helpful and accommodating hosts! The home is well appointed. tasteful and spacious. The best feature is their back patio - breathtaking views accompany unbridled relaxation. We spent our mornings and nights out there. New Years was a blast as we felt we had the best observation deck for the surrounding firework shows.

5859458,Kendo,December,2018,Ross was super nice and is knowledgeable about the area. I would go back.
5859458,Anne,December,2018,Ross & Koren's place was exactly as advertised. beautifully decorated. and sparkling clean.   There was plenty of kitchen equipment. and beach towels and chairs.
5859458,James,December,2018,This was great!  I hadn't been to Puerto Rico before. and didn't know what to expect.  We were just there for a quick overnight. but would have enjoyed a longer stay.  The place is spacious and clean.    Ross was very responsive to help us get checked in.
5859458,Julio,November,2018,Ross place is amazing. Very quiet and close to all the action. Beautiful house with all you need for a great vacation. Will stay here again for sure.
5859458,Trent,October,2018,This was an amazing place to stay for the night. Ross and his wife were extremely welcoming and had great suggestions for the local beaches and places to eat.
5859458,Antonio,October,2018,Good apartment and greater hosts. Highly recommendable.
5859458,Vanessa,September,2018,Ross and Koren have an amazing place! This was our second stay with them (which already says a lot about how much we like it) and both were extremely relaxing- just what we were looking for. They live above the apartment. but you would never know it because you never hear them while staying. plus the apartment has a private entrance and back patio with an incredible view! Their place is on a quiet dead end street and is super conveniently located- 5 minutes to the beach and town square. Thank you Ross and Koren! We will continue to recommend you!
5859458,Randolph,September,2018,Beautiful. stylish. spacious and clean place with a beautiful terrace to enjoy breakfast.  Good location and excellent tips about the local area were provided in the welcome book.
5859458,Anthony,August,2018,Great place for value. Highly recommend.
5859458,Matthew,August,2018,Very clean home with great views and everything you would need for a comfortable stay.
5859458,Vanessa,August,2018,Ross and Koren's place is fantastic! It is one of those rare Airbnbs that is actually nicer than the photos. Koren was a fantastic host. easy to communicate with and offered great tips. Plus. the place is super clean and comfortable. We had a fatastic stay in Rincon and would recommend this home to anyone!
5859458,Nicole,August,2018,Such a clean welcoming space! Very comfortable place. so much space. and so thoughtfully stocked with things you would need!  Would deystay again if I ever ended up Rincon!
5859458,Ingrid,August,2018,Really great place and great location. Last minute reservation needed and worked out in our favor and the host as well.  Was only able to enjoy one night but I‚Äôm sure we will use this host again fantastic huge space.
5859458,Michaela,July,2018,This is a beautiful home with an absolutely amazing view! Our stay was perfectly comfortable. and Ross was super responsive. The only issue that we had was with the neighboring roosters - they were very spirited and surprisingly crowed at most hours of the night. Something to note but nothing to rule out your stay!!
5859458,Rosana,July,2018,We loved Casa Kunkel! Great place for a family or anybody looking to be close to action but values a great night sleep away from the city noise. Very clean and spacious place with everything you might need. Thank you Koren for taking us in especially after such a short notice! üòÇ We'll be back soon!!! Luis. Rosana. Ari & Adri√°n
5859458,Nichol,July,2018,The space is huge and comfortable.  You're in the heart of a neighborhood yet still connected to city life.  Easy to get to beaches. eateries or comfort food cooked at their place.  It's internet TV. (if that's your thing) which can be a headache sometimes but the hosts will always update you with issues.  It's nice to hear the coquis at night and roosters in the am.  They have 2 great dogs whose bark is bigger than their bite. It's fans no ac which isn't a problem since they have a great breeze through the whole place. Can't wait to stay again.
5859458,Mimi (Stephanie),June,2018,We really enjoyed our short time in Rincon! The place was beautiful and so spacious! The converted king bed worked great! We loved hanging on the hammock on the back porch and the place was incredibly clean! There are beautiful views and scenery from the back porch. We really enjoyed a morning run on the hills surrounding the place- lots of cute dogs and friendly locals. Take note: There is no AC (but with the fans- it‚Äôs perfectly manageable and comfortable). there are squawking chickens at all hours and the apartment can get somewhat buggy. But overall. it was a great place for the visit and we enjoyed Rincon!
5859458,Adam,April,2018,Just awesome. Period. Ross and his Family are awesome hosts with a truly great place. Large. modern. perfectly clean. and filled with thoughtful little touches all over. It's in a great residential location (and with a really pretty view over a lush green valley). yet only 5-6 minutes from Rinc√≥n city center or most of the good beaches. Highly recommend this place. as it's a great house in a great location with great hosts. My best airBnB so far üòÅüòé
5859458,Vanessa,April,2018,This place was perfect! We had a blast and the house was clean and spacious and absolutely breathtaking views. Couldn't have found a better place to stay in Rinc√≥n!
5859458,Shelly,April,2018,House was true to the pictures. Great space and super clean. The view was fabulous. Ross and his family are super friendly and helpful. Thanks for the great vacation!!!!
5859458,Jordan,January,2018,Ross was a great host and Rinc√≥n was an awesome place to spend a few days.
5859458,Jennifer,January,2018,This place is amazing.  I am your typical ‚ÄúType A‚Äù personality and tend to be abit obsessive about the cleanliness of the place I am staying.  Well.... this place is immaculate.  Wow!!  So clean!  The shower was spotless and the kitchen looks brand new.  Ross and his wife are incredibly kind and extremely attentive.  They really made sure all of my needs were met.  I cannot think of one negative to mention and for a New Yorker this is extremely rare!!On a side note:  Ross is actually a pretty well known surf coach in the area.  If you would like to surf. he is your go to.  He is quite booked and can be hard to get but if you book early enough you might be able to get him.  He has surfboards and will take you to all the spots depending on your skill level.  He is extremely concerned with your safety.  I never felt on my own or in an area that made me feel uncomfortable.I had such a great time!  Slept like a baby. surfed great waves!!  I am sure you will have the same:))Travel well!!Show more
5859458,Lara,August,2017,The place is very spacious and kept very clean. I loved the big terrace with the view. Also Koren was very responsive and helpful. Coming from a big city with small apartments we appreciated all the space and the tropical landscape. There are roosters nearby though. and they sing very early...
5859458,Nova,August,2017,This place was better than I expected. The rooms were huge and it also has a pretty big kitchen. The balcony in the back has an AMAZING view where you can watch the sun rise over thousands of trees. The host is also extremely helpful and so friendly I love her! She helped us out a lot and gave us tips on where to go and was also flexible about reservation dates when our plans got messed up. Fair warning: It is in an area with lots of bugs so bring some bug spray! Also the roosters never stop yelling but it's also not unbearable. it's equivalent to the sound of crickets chirping.10/10 would recommend!!!
5859458,Brent,August,2017,Ross was very responsive and fast to answer any questions we had. The house was clean and completely stocked with anything you could need to cook. go to the beach etc...  The view from the back porch was awesome and you have complete privacy here. It's very close to all sorts of great places and things to do even in the down season for tourist and is easy to get in and out of driving wise. We'll definitely be coming back in the future. Thanks Ross & Koren
5859458,Jose,July,2017,Awesome place!! Good price!! Chill!! Surfers dream!

5859458,Emily,March,2017,Fantastic place! Ross was able to accommodate our semi last minute booking and we are so happy we decided to go to rincon! This may have been one of the cleanest Airbnbs we've ever stayed in and we've been to many. Hosts were kind enough to let us borrow their snorkel gear.
5859458,Rose,March,2017,If you're considering a trip to PR. go to Rincon. and stay here! The place was perfect. and close to everything in town. Peaceful and quiet neighborhood. and the natural alarm clock of the roosters was a nice way to start the day. Ross was an excellent host- he made himself available to help us out in any way he could. He even took the time to show us around Rincon and point out the best beaches. bars. and restaurants. The three of us had never been surfing before. and Ross was a great surf instructor as well. We were sad to leave and hope to be back soon!
5859458,Jacqueline,March,2017,Very spacious 2 bedroom & 2 bath beachstlyle apt.  Perfect for family of 4 or 2 couples. Lots of fans to cool the air for sleeping. Big kitchen & cute cozy living room area with big tv. Wonderful host & hostess who own the house & live upstairs.

5859458,Dave,March,2017,I can't say enough amazing things about Ross and his beautiful family. They were so welcoming and helped us get acquainted and acclimated to our first stop in Puerto Rico. We got a flat tire the very first night in town. and he went above and beyond to help us get a new car in a nearby town. The place itself is unbelievable. Clean. spacious. and a beautiful patio with a view to boot. I highly recommend staying here if you're in town!
5859458,Juan,February,2017,Great place
5859458,Michell,February,2017,Beautiful home away from the party scene and in wonderful area. The home was exactly as described and plenty of room. Very close to dive shop we used (5 min drive) and beaches. Ross was a superb host and answered many questions. Super super clean and very safe neighborhood. We live in country area so at night we felt at home listening to birds. rooster alarm cracked us up as we have one at home too! If your looking for a relaxing island retreat this is your home. Thank you Ross and Korean! We will definitely be returning again.
5859458,Kayla,November,2016,Cannot speak highly enough about Ross and Koren and their amazing apartment. The apartment was large and beautiful and had all the amenities you're not used to in Puerto Rico - large cable TV. great wifi. hot water. well equipped kitchen and was nice and breezy throughout. Though it was just me and my husband staying there. we hosted a Thanksgiving dinner for 7 and there was more than enough space to do so. We loved sitting on the back porch having coffee in the mornings and loved how close we were to surf spots and shopping/dining. Ross was super helpful with suggestions and even let my hubs borrow a surfboard for the week. Such an enjoyable experience all around. Truly exceeded expectations. Can't wait to come back and stay again! Show more

All the amenities are included. even a blender for making fresh watermelon-prosecco drinks! The location is convenient; no more than a 10 minute drive to just about everything. I would certainly stay here again.
5859458,Steve,May,2016,We had an excellent time. Beautiful house with a ton of room! Ross was a great host and was a pleasure to deal with. Anything we needed he had or knew where to go. Close distance to beaches and restaurants. Definitely will be back!

5859458,Debra,March,2016,Ross and Koren were the best!  They made us feel very welcome.  Ross drove us around town and pointed out where the best restaurants were.  We are two moms who took their high school seniors boys on a surf spring break vacation.  We also hired hired Ross to teach the boys how to surf.  He took them out everyday to all the different surf spots.  We felt very comfortable knowing they were in the hands of a very competent instructor.   The place was everything I expected and more. It was very clean and well maintained.  Loved having coffee out on the deck each morning.  The view was even better than the pictures. The beaches were just a short drive away.
5859458,Andrew,March,2016,We had a blast staying at Ross & Koren's home.  They were so welcoming and helpful.  The kids loved the space and can not wait to go back.  One of the best AirBnB stays to date!
5859458,Keith,February,2016,Ross and Koren's place is great. We stayed there for 3 weeks and were immediately comfortable. The apartment has everything you could need. Ross Koren are really great hosts and super helpful. This is the only place we would stay in Rincon if we go back.

As soon as we arrived he let us get settled in and then took the time to drive us around town and point out some of his favorite places. The space was beautiful. clean. and close to all the action in Rincon. Next time we're in town we know our first choice for where to stay!
5859458,Clare,January,2016,We loved staying in this cozy apartment during our visit to Rincon. The house is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. but still has easy access to the beaches and restaurants of Rincon. We especially loved spending lazy afternoons on the balcony overlooking the lush PR greenery. As for the apartment. it was spacious. very stocked with new furniture. The beds were especially comfortable and laundry access was a huge plus. Although we didn't get to meet Ross. he was very responsive via text and had great restaurant recommendations. A great Airbnb
5859458,Erik,December,2015,I could not say more great things about Ross and Koren's awesome apartment.  The place is beautiful. and the view off the back deck is exactly why most people go to Rincon in the first place.  You're close enough to town and the beach to do whatever you'd like. but you feel like your far enough away for it to be a vacation.  The entire family. including their epic dog Chloe. welcomed me with open arms and went above and beyond to make this one of the best get-aways I've had in a long. long time.  Thanks again for the wonderful hospitality.  I'll be back soon enough!

The location is central to several nice beaches and surf spots. We even got to do surf lessons with Ross and he is a great teacher. Would absolutely stay again.
5859458,Gerold & Laura,November,2015,This is really a fantastic place. we have been travelling through the whole island but by far Ross place has been the best. The pictures do not show all the beauty of the house and its surrounding. I can just recommend to everybody to stay here in case you are in Rincon. As a side comment Ross is also a very good surf teacher and he together with his wife are wonderful people.

It is clean. spacious. nicely appointed. and conveniently located. The back balcony is a real treat and we spent lots of time there early in the morning and early in the evening. It overlooks the top of the luscious trees with a distant view to the ocean. It was a great spot for breakfast. cocktails. or a late night cup of tea. I will definitely consider staying here again. Thanks Ross!

2208735,Spencer,February,2017,Very cozy place. Great location. up on the hill where it's quiet but a short driving distance to tons of businesses and beaches. Great host and family. Would recommend this place for a 2-3 person trip to use as a home base.
2208735,Megan,January,2016,We were very lucky that Kimberly was able to accommodate a last minute reservation after we had issues with our previous airbnb spot. We were sorry not to meet her. but her directions and instructions were  thorough. so we had no problems at all. We were greeted by an extremely friendly little dog. which we assumed lived there. but discovered soon enough that he was a stray....fortunately. he was adopted by someone at the nearby English Rose B&B. or else we may have acted on our rash impulse to bring him home with us!  Rincon is fabulous. the beaches are great. and we scoped out some really wonderful restaurants (Copa Ilena down by the marina is a must visit. and the Shipwreck has good food. too). The surf was very high while we were there. so my husband's surf lesson was a little hairy. but it made for some pretty dramatic surf watching.  The Casita is cozy. but suited the two of us well. It's true that you won't hear any roosters. or noise from clubs. but the air conditioning noise from the other units is quite loud....and music and conversation is all shared with other guests. as the outdoor balconies all face the same direction. Not a problem. just a head's up. The balcony off the back of the Casita was private enough for us to enjoy our evening glass of wine. The internet does not work at the Casita. but is somewhat better if you go up the side stairs to the upper level. If you really have to have internet. probably not the best location. but it was fine for us. There's also a good size television. which was kind of a treat for us since we choose not to have TV at home. If you stay at Kimberly's. you have to have breakfast at The English Rose! It is just a short walk down the hill. so don't drive-it gets very congested with cars and the entire half mile road up from the main road is narrow and steep. After the English Rose closes later in the day the road is quieter. but in the morning expect to meet other cars on the way up or down. and take it slow (honk at the corners. and hope you don't meet the garbage truck!). I was glad that the parking at Kimberly's was spacious. even with several cars parked. After spending several days in Anasco. and a day in Aguadilla and Isabel. I would choose to come back to Rincon!Show more
2208735,Alee,January,2016,We had a great stay in our humble little place. Location was great and Kimberly had a good communication with us. We will surely be back.
2208735,Tara,December,2014,Prior to our arrival. Kimberly was quick to respond to our questions as we prepared for our trip. which was appreciated. The Casita was charming and equipped with clean sheets. a refrigerator. coffee maker. plenty of towels. toilet paper. and some basic utensils and plates. Those who are considering renting the Casita should know that the ocean view seen in the photos on the ad are not visible from the Casita. The wifi connection is also extremely weak in the Casita. and was unusable for us. which was fine for us because we were able to look up any information we needed using our phones. but may be important to others. It is also worth knowing that the Casita is located at the top a very steep. narrow. windy road which. to us. felt a bit dangerous to drive on. Make sure to honk when rounding corners! Though a bit treacherous. the drive from the Casita to the nearest beach (Steps) is just a couple minutes. and it is beautiful. We didn't meet our hosts. and the one question we asked during our trip went unanswered. but we had the basics we needed in the Casita and enjoyed our days spent on the lovely beaches of Rincon.
2208735,Response from Tim,December,2014,Would definitely have Ben again. He was vey respectful and super clean. We have never refunded someone their cleaning fee before until Ben. He left the place completely  spotless and ready to re rent including extra toilet paper and paper  towels. Thank you for such a great experience.Show more
2208735,Laura,July,2014,We arrived in Rincon after landing very early in the morning in Aguadilla (from NYC).   We were tired and hot and couldn't wait to grab a quick nap before heading out to one of the many. many nearby (and gorgeous) beaches.  When we arrived at Cozy Casita. after driving very slowly over hilly. windy. narrow. dark roads. it was still dark and no one was around.  We let ourselves in per Kimberley's instructions and were thrilled to find the air conditioner.  We turned it on and promptly fell asleep.  When we woke. it was daylight and we opened the door to the small. attached. private balcony to discover a gorgeous view overlooking a valley.  Banana trees. starfruit trees. mango trees. and nature galore made this a lovely starting point to what turned out to be a wonderful vacation in Puerto Rico.  The English Rose is nearby if you want to grab a nice breakfast but the room includes a microwave. mini fridge. utensils and coffee maker so it's easy to make your own salads or snacks.  We stayed two nights and spent a lot of time at the nearby beaches (Steps Beach was one of our favorites and less than 5 minutes drive from Cozy Casita) but we did stay indoors one night and watched movies on the flat screen t.v.  The Cozy Casita isn't luxurious but it was quaint. cozy. clean and private -- perfect for a couple. There were towels and one roll of toilet paper but we had to provide our own TP after that and dishwashing soap. My partner and I were quite comfortable here and would highly recommend it.                Show more
2208735,Kate & Brian,April,2014,Had a great stay at Kimberly's casita! She even left us a few delicious bananas. Puerto Rico was fantastic. and we loved the location. Great spot for day trips and exploring the Rincon area.   Though this rental is on a private property. the casita itself is not very private‚Äîthe neighboring rentals are extremely close by. That said. once everyone else is asleep. the natural soundtrack to the area is amazingly peaceful. Very clean. felt extremely safe.   If I came back. I'd stay in one of Kimberly's units that has a kitchen‚Äîso much great produce made me want to cook!
2208735,Jillian,March,2014,Kim and Tim were wonderful hosts! I loved being away from town and enjoying the ride down from the hill in the morning. We stayed in the purple place for ten days. and it was the best tens days my boy friend and I shared. we didn't need a resort. a hotel. or anything fancy which is why it was so nice to stay at Cozy Casita. I would refer this to my friends and family or anyone else that is staying in Rincon. We are even planning our second Rincon trip and choosing to stay their again! :)
549127461028989443,Maggi,December,2022,Very easy to check in and place was described accurately. Was lovely to have air conditioning in the bedrooms and the beds were very comfortable. Location was walking distance from the downtown area and a very quick drive (or longer walk) from the beaches. We did a lot of meal preparing and found that the kitchen wasn't super well equipped for cooking. We ended up purchasing some items in order to make meals (cutting board. mixing bowl. cooking utensils etc.) but items were easily found at the supermarket and left at the house.The washing machine and dryer were great to have and we bought a laundry line so we could line dry clothing and towels from the beach. All in all. great spot for a casual stay in Rincon!
549127461028989443,Shari,November,2022,Clean. quiet. cute. safe. close to the quaint city center.
549127461028989443,Elliott,August,2022,Clean. great location and great host
549127461028989443,Leyla,November,2022,Beautiful. very typical little house with a nice backyard.  The air conditioning works perfectly in all 3 bedrooms but it is hot in the living room.  We loved the location. the parking available. the code lock. the cleanliness of the place. the tranquility of the neighborhood and the little gift on arrival. A charm!Translated from French¬†¬†Show original

21400683,Jason,October,2022,A great place to stay on the beach in Rincon. The place had everything we needed and the owner (Jim) and the staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed for five nights. The first three days and nights were perfect and peaceful. The last full day and last two nights were very loud with thumping music from the restaurant next door. I guess this may have been an opening-for-the-season party with lots of local folks but not the experience we were looking for. Nothing anyone could do about that and overall the place and people were excellent.
21400683,Jessica,August,2022,it was perfect
21400683,Response from Jim,August,2022,Anton. I was visiting my mom in a remote area of south Georgia and didn't get your message until a day later. Theft is really not a problem in Rincon...generally but super sorry for your shoes. You were a great guest and hate this left that impression on you.Show more
21400683,Jennifer,July,2022,Great location and easy access to the beach!
21400683,Dino,July,2022,We had the best stay at Jim's place. It was magical. Eric his superintendent was very helpful. and taking care of the property and backyard daily. We will definitely be back.
21400683,Shakine,June,2022,Place is as advertised!!!! Awesome!!!
21400683,Response from Jim,April,2022,You're always welcome here Dhruv. Stay in touch amigo.
21400683,Mr. Vermont,March,2022,We came to Puerto Rico on vacation for 10 days and stayed in 4 different AirBnB locations to get a feel for the diversity of the island. We loved opening the front door to our 2nd floor room and being able to see straight through to the beautiful. palm lined. aqua ocean beyond our private terrace where we sipped coffee each morning.  The accommodations are not high tech. modern but have more of a beach house feel. but with everything we needed. in fact. more than we needed. What host provides ear plugs!  We did ask if there were any beach towels and next thing we knew we had a brand new towel with the tags still on it. Jim did not need to do that. We could have made do but it just demonstrates that he will go out of his way to be sure his guests are happy.  It‚Äôs the perfect location to enjoy an uncrowded. nearly private. clean and sandy beach. nearby spots for good food. music and enjoying the sunset. Our 2 nights leave us with fond memories.
21400683,Lindsay And Scott,March,2022,Comfortable and clean. Simple life. right on the beach. Outdoor shower. hot indoor shower and great porch. Could have laid in all the hammocks forever. Host is quick to respond and friendly about the property. Hope to return.
21400683,Response from Jim,February,2022,You guys were awesome and we hope to see you each year. Stay safe and warm amiga!
21400683,Response from Jim,February,2022,Some of our best and friendliest guests are the locals and we cherish these relationships... especially as friends in life here on the Island.
21400683,Response from Jim,February,2022,You guys made it easy to be a good host. wish you could have seen all the Humpback Whales jumping out front today.
21400683,Patrick,February,2022,Location can't be beat.  It is rustic and comfortable and Jim Springer was communicated well and was attentive.
21400683,Linda,January,2022,Awesome location.
21400683,Javier,January,2022,Great place. Great location and Insuperable Host!!
21400683,Anton,January,2022,Amazing location! Can not beat it if you are looking to be right on the beach. Jim is very responsive and willing to answer any questions throughout your length of stay and makes sure you have everything you need. He truly cares and wants his guest to have a wonderful stay. highly recommend his beautiful place.
21400683,Alfonso,January,2022,Jim‚Äôs place has an extraordinary & superb location and nice common areas to use while enjoying the access to the beach.The apartment has all the basics you need for a pleasant stay.
21400683,Alejandra,December,2021,Pelican point is a great location in Rincon.  Not only was the unit well equipped but perfect location to great beaches and amazing restaurants.  He was very communicative and quick to respond.   We will stay here again!
21400683,Sarah,November,2021,Amazing view and outdoor space. Great location near restaurants and surf spots. Definitely recommend.
21400683,Alphonse,October,2021,this place is all about location and definitely has a wonderful view. the room itself is a comfortable stay and provides all you need but is definitely a place for enjoying the balcony. courtyard and beach which for us was perfect! the balcony gets almost no sun so you can enjoy a coffee and scenery without breaking out sun screen or sunglasses. the courtyard is sunny with plenty of shady spots and the beach is as much sun as you would like.
21400683,Keanna,October,2021,Location. Location. Location. The view from the room is beautiful and there‚Äôs a little restaurant literally RIGHT next-door. Simple and relaxing
21400683,George,September,2021,The place was great! Clean. hospitable and close to everything in Rincon. the patio was incredible and the hammocks were great!
21400683,Paola,August,2021,We love the location. Great ocean view from our balcony. Everything was clean and perfect .  Carlos was very helpful and we actually visited one of the places he suggested to us. We definitely going back in our next trip to Puerto Rico.
21400683,Response from Jim,July,2021,Denise. for any future reservation please check well and organize yourself  ...there is no place here stating we have Wi-Fi in the amenities... thats a gift from us to our guest...is not advertised as amenity due to unstable service ... you saw Carlos on your stay and never asked for Wi-Fi password or tried to comunicate via text email or calling Carlos...sorry you wasted your time running up and down without finding the place. we have our name on all walls and in front of the building. Carlos phone number is on the answer of your inquiry. on contract and on several parts of the building.Show more
21400683,Marivette,July,2021,It's great location. Beautiful patio just in front of the beach.  The power went out an entire day and they're not prepared for this kind of situation. They need a power generator. I tried to contacted them to ask for a late check out and they don't reply. Also other guests were complaining for the same thing. they couldn't communicate with the owners and left in the middle of their stay.
21400683,Response from Jim,July,2021,Sorry Shay. we've not heard of either issue but will look in to them both. Thanks for letting us know. Jim
21400683,Sendy,June,2021,If you are looking for the BEST beach in PR. then this is it. We drove from San Juan to Ricon. then to Cabo Rojo . Ponce and Guayama..and this was the best beach by far. The waves were a little tall BUT it is known for surfing. SO! I loved the nature around it. the views and that we had rain fall while sitting at the beach. No sargaso or seaweed here. This area is very quiet and secluded. We didn't see too many tourist. We went to the restaurant next door Tamboo and a bar across the street and it was ok...just chill. We didn't use the outside grill but there was another guest and family using it and were enjoying it. BE advise. the power goes out A LOT in PR. we lost power the two days we were there and it gets HOT. Surprisingly. there is hardly any breeze. Also. the unit we were in (B) had flash lights that didn't work. The mosquitos are ridiculous. Jim did provide bug spray. but it was useless.  Living area and bedrooms were good. Bedrooms have AC.  No beach towels. or equipment (ball. shade. chairs etc.) We didn't cook. because we were staying for such a short stay but the kitchen can use some extra tools. and I have suggested water (at least for arrival). TV worked good. when we had power. but we were not able to get on WIFI. When the power did go out the first night (4hrs) me and other guest were calling the host but we did not get an answer or a call back. We didn't see him until the next day. Lastly. one thing that we didn't like. when we returned from the beach the host was at the stairway and said to us that our unit was opened already....why would you open it?? We didn't ask. but found that weird.  BTW. this unit B has a tree blocking the ocean view. It didn't bother us. but just FYI..Show more
21400683,Crafted,June,2021,Best view ever
21400683,Paola,May,2021,Had a great time with friends. great common area
21400683,Eric,May,2021,Great spot right on the beach with a sandy area great for swimming. A few places to eat within a short walk and many places nearby. Great view and beautiful area. Carlos was always around ready to offer suggestions of things to do and to make sure we had everything we needed.
21400683,Isabel,May,2021,We really enjoyed the stay. the location and the view from the balcony is just fantastic. Would definitely come back.
21400683,Larry,April,2021,If I could put six stars on communication and location I would do it. Carlos was fantastic!!! The location on the beach was perfect. I'm not a surfer but if I was perfect surf was directly off my back porch. We really enjoyed walking on the beach every morning and collecting sea glass. Nice restaurants and organic food shopping all very close. I am working on deciding where to live on the island and this is now at the top of my list. A must visit for sure!!!
21400683,Jack,April,2021,This was an incredible trip and wonderful place to stay. Carlos the host was THE MAN. We will come back here and strongly recommend anyone to stay here that can... P A R A D I S E
21400683,Joe,March,2021,Could not have had a better time staying at Jim's BNB. The view from the second floor porch is breathtaking. The hammock was a welcome respite. and Jim and Carlos were extremely helpful and considerate. The waves were excellent right off the front of the property for experienced surfers and beginners alike. There is surfboard rental adjacent to the property. and plenty of bars/restaurants within walking distance. Would love to stay again.
21400683,Delia,January,2021,Excellent location and tremendous service.
21400683,Beril,December,2020,Fabulous spot directly on the water in gorgeous sandy beach. Carlos was a phenomenal resource - wholly committed to ensuring that we had the best experience. Stay here!
21400683,David,October,2020,The place is an excellent place to stay .
21400683,Maritza,October,2020,At Jim's place we were hosted by Carlos.  He was a fantastic host --- attentive. helpful and very accessible.  I would definitely go back again!
21400683,Carlos,July,2020,Awesome spot!
21400683,Matt,March,2020,The outside cooking and sitting areas alone make this place worth staying in. The property was clean and exactly as pictured in the photos. Carlos was an amazing host. and did everything he could to make our stay is great as possible. Super close to great facilities like kahuna burger the pool bar and Tamboo. as well as  World class surfing!
21400683,Ann,February,2020,Beautiful beach location with lots of great surf beaches and bars/restaurants nearby
21400683,Kate,February,2020,Pelican Point is an unbeatable location. The apartments were much better than expected. fully equipped with great kitchens. lovely living space. and outstanding views. This is one of the most convenient places to stay in Rincon with the easiest access to an incredible beach and great food options within walking distance. I would highly recommend any of these apartments!
21400683,Malik,December,2019,Great Place.  Great Location.  Carlos is amazing.  Friday night next to Tamboo. not great.  Its one thing to have music overtly blazing. its another thing for it to be so terrible.  Regardless. we will be back.
21400683,David,November,2019,Great location! Beautiful place to stay.
21400683,Cristina,September,2019,Everything is great except for the parking area! Everything else is perfect
21400683,Edgardo,July,2019,Thanks for the hospitality. Excellent place.!! my family and I enjoyed the stay. Thank you!
21400683,Rosario,July,2019,This place what has is  a very good location.  the beach is front side.  Don't expect a pretty apartment with great commodities.  It needs better maintenance.  Is too expensive for its present state.
21400683,Maria,May,2019,It‚Äôs a great apartment with a beautiful view. Next to great local entertainment and right in front of the beach. The apartment is fully equipped for cooking and the best thing is...the hammock!
21400683,Justin,March,2019,This place was incredible - hats off to Carlos and the entire crew. The location was beautiful. every amenity was provided. the beach was wonderful. and we will most definitely be returning to stay here again.
21400683,Caitlin,March,2019,The location was amazing!
21400683,Joanne,March,2019,It's true. there is a bar next store.  Sun. Mon. Tue. and Thurs they are excellent neighbors.
21400683,Nick,February,2019,Great place to stay. Wonderful location in the heart of Sandy Beach.
21400683,Matt,February,2019,We had a very nice stay at Pelican Pointe! Jim and Carlos are great with communication. The view from our balcony over looking the ocean was amazing. The outdoor area was great for hanging in the day. Such a lovely town and you can walk to a fun surf break. We would definitely stay again!
21400683,Lunar Mgmt.,January,2019,Exactly what we expected. Right on the ocean. close to everything! We actually were able to leave early too due to the noise from taboo! (Yes the noise is loud and we expected that! But some people we traveled with didn't! ) Remember. you are located right next to taboo (Bar+ Nightlife) So just be aware that people party on the weekends! Embrace it!
21400683,Connie,January,2019,Enjoyed staying at Pelican Point. It‚Äôs right on Sandy Beach. and. had there not been a massive swell the weekend I was there. the beach would have been a great spot to chill out. Carlos was very helpful and easy to reach; he was even kind enough to prepare some fresh coconuts for myself and my friends. I saw some complaints about the noise from Tamboo Tavern. which my friends and I didn‚Äôt have a massive problem with - we ended up staying out when we realized it was futile to sleep through it and had a great time bar hopping in the neighborhood. My only complaints were that I felt that the bed in the master bedroom could have been a bit more comfortable (the mattress felt a bit like an air mattress) and the water pressure in the shower was a little underwhelming.
21400683,Alexander,December,2018,Absolutely fabolous place! Dreamlike location and Great sand backyard with outdoor-kitchen. such a Nice experience to dine with wine here:)
21400683,Nanysma,November,2018,"The location is outstanding. the view. the property has many amenities. specially of you go with a group or kids. you can have everybody ""around"".The neighbor ""Tamboo"". has live music Friday and Saturday until 2:00am so be prepare to listen  or party"
21400683,Brian,November,2018,Great place. great value. highly recommended
21400683,Response from Jim,September,2018,This concern is being worked on. The owners of the bar are very rude at times (when they get in the party mood) but I assure you this is being aggressive addressed legally as we try so hard to make everything perfect. We expect to have this resolved before years end.Show more
21400683,Carlos,July,2018,The place is even better than it looks.  If you're looking for a retreat from busy everyday life. this is the place! The bar next door kept its music low enough that you had to get out of the apartment to listen to it!  Both Carlos and Heriberto were great hosts. and were available for every doubt or question I had.  All in all. a great experience.  Looking forward to staying there again!
21400683,Allysson,July,2018,One of the best place I‚Äôve stayed.  Really nice place. the view is breathtaking!!
21400683,Edith,July,2018,Place was ok. Not as many amenities nearby as hoped.  Beach was too rocky.
21400683,Vita,July,2018,Location was absolutely amazing! The view was spectacular and the property was true to what was described. My only suggestion is possibly updating the furnishings (somewhat dated) and providing more comfy patio furniture in the backyard area. Otherwise. we had a great time not to mention. Carlos (the property manager) was awesome!!
21400683,Alison,June,2018,The condos at Pelican Point are amazing.  The pictures represent exactly what you see and it is truly an amazing property in an amazing location.  The location is perfect as it is a little secluded but you are able to walk down the beach and see the beauty of the water in little tide pools.  The restaurant/bar next-door does have music on the weekends which you can hear outside in the patio area and we enjoyed listening to it.  Carlos is amazing and was very responsive to our needs.  He gave us wonderful recommendations to eat and for recreational sports.  PP in Rincon is definitely the place to stay in Puerto Rico!
21400683,Rebecca,June,2018,Our second time in Rincon and we absolutely loved staying here! First off. the view is amazing!! It is the perfect beach house. Pelican Point has such a great beach town atmosphere and vibe. It‚Äôs a perfect little spot with great food close by. and cute little shops.
21400683,Evymar,May,2018,Beautiful location! Our host was s√∫per friendly and helpful. Felt really tempted to extend our stay. ‚ù§Ô∏è
21400683,Gabriel,April,2018,Carlos was great. he gave us amazing restaurant recommendations!!
21400683,Allison,March,2018,We had a great stay at Pelican Point. Jim and Carlos were always available to help and give great local tips and recommendations. The location was fantastic. right on the beach and great accessibility to BBQ. dining. lounge areas.
21400683,Brian,February,2018,My group rented two (2) apartments at Pelican Point during our stay. Wonderful location and great hosts! They even gave a great recommendation for a road trip to gain cultural experiences in PR. Local knowledge experts with quick followup! Would go back again.
21400683,Response from Jim,February,2018,Thanks a lot for considering us for your get away spot. If there is something that comes to mind about how we can improve please let us know.Thanks guys. you were excellent and welcome here any time! Hope to see you soon!! Show more

Everything else. very clean. a beautiful ocean view. facilities for BBQ. hammocks. beach chairs and a good place to play dominoes next to the beach and enjoy the sun.

9609980,Cindy,November,2022,Incredible gem tucked near highway 413. I went for a 3 day stay in Rincon from the east side of the island and it was a perfect solo getaway. The studio was more than ideal for coming and going. Loved that there was A/C and a mini fridge to store food plus an outdoor hose to take off the sand. I ran into Vanessa and Greg one morning as I was headed out and they were amazing people! The cherry on top is the rooftop deck with incredible views. Absolutely will return here on my next road trip out west!
9609980,Andrea,November,2022,Beautiful view from the studio and from the terrace! Very clear instructions and they provided recommendations for the area ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you for having us!

9609980,Eric,July,2022,What a lovely stay. clean and comfortable room. great location. would stay again and recommend.
9609980,Lauren,July,2022,Had an amazing stay at the boarding house! Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to rincon. Only a few minute drive from the main spots in puntas. Self check in was super easy. The room was cute. quiet and clean. had everything we needed.  The bed was also soo comfy I slept great here. You can tell Vanessa put a lot of thought into the decor and details which we loved. She provides beach chairs. towels. snorkel gear etc. Vanessa was also quick to respond during our stay if we needed anything. even when she was not at the house. The rooftop is amazing and definitely a highlight of the place! Wish I could have spent more time here. Cannot recommend their place enough.
9609980,Katie,July,2022,Vanessa created a space that was healing and comforting to be in. Her natural way of being was just what you would hope for in a Rincon stay. The location and solitude offered was perfect.
9609980,Valdemar,July,2022,Great location. it serves a great central point for exploring different parts of east side of Puerto Rico. It is a small room with just enough space for two. and had a fridge and some dishes. I would recommend for a couple that plans on being out and about a lot. The view and rooftop were amazing.
9609980,Alex,July,2022,Great Airbnb. great location in rincon. It‚Äôs about a 10 min drive from all the restaurants and bars. Clean and great views on rooftop patio!
9609980,Phil,July,2022,Selected this efficiency room for a quick weekend stay and it was just as advertised. Host was awesome with all the details and communication before. during and after. The terrace area was lovely for the scenic view. breeze and sounds of nature. Just a short drive from all Rincon has to offer.
9609980,Response from Vanessa,July,2022,It was such a pleasure to meet you! Thanks for this beautiful review!
9609980,Heather,June,2022,The Seaglass studio was perfect for me during my 9 day stay. Comfortable bed and the room and bath were clean and tidy. I had everything that I needed. I have already recommended the Boardinghouse to friends.
9609980,Rafael,May,2022,Positives:1. Very clean2. Easy Access.3. Good hot water.4. Comfortable bed.5. Coffee provided6. Great communication from the host.7. Plenty of electrical outlets.Negatives:1. No microwave in the room for heating the leftovers from the local restaurants or to heat your coffee. The property has a comunal microwave in one of the hallways.2. No bodysoap. nor shampoo. Stated in their description. but does not help the traveler.3. No sugar for the coffee.
9609980,Ariadne,May,2022,This place is really peaceful with an amazing view.
9609980,Luben,May,2022,Excelente spot
9609980,Gaby,May,2022,Super clean and comfy!
9609980,Yomna,May,2022,The best view and Airbnb!! Loved our stay
9609980,Jennifer,May,2022,The Boarding House was a great home base for our two days in Rinc√≥n! Perched among the hills. Vanessa & Greg‚Äôs place is a quick drive down to Sandy Beach or across to Domes Beach. Good amount of restaurants a short drive away too! And of course the rooftop is absolutely delightful. So comfy and beautiful!
9609980,Andrew,April,2022,Exactly as advertised. Beautiful view from high vantage point. Centrally located with many amazing beaches and restaurants only minutes away. Rooftop was awesome.
9609980,Greg,April,2022,The seaglass room at the Boarding House PR is in close proximity to multiple surf spots/beaches and some local restaurants and bars. It's a short drive to the downtown area. While we were there. we explored the local beaches. the light house. and took a day trip down to Cabo Rojo to see the salt flats and stopped in Boqueron on the way back. It's a good central location to explore areas outside Rincon. to stay local and grab a beer/cocktail/smoothie at El Bohio bar. or even to relax and take in the views on the amazing roof patio. We would definitely stay here again.
9609980,Lindsey,April,2022,Beautiful views from the terrace with hammocks and chairs. and  a comfortable and clean room. Hosts allow you to borrow beach equipment like chairs. noodles. snorkels and boogie boards. which is great. Hosts are very hands-off. but send explicit instructions for  self check-in/check-out. Though it was fine in the end. and provided for great views of the water from above. this spot was farther away from the beach than I initially thought. The roads are very dark and winding at night. which puts a damper on how many cervezas one can have. BUT. if cute. comfortable and quiet are what you're after. this place is great.
9609980,Alicia,April,2022,Vanessa was great and we absolutely loved our stay here! Great location and the rooftop is incredible
9609980,Waleska,March,2022,Thanks you for having us and lending us all we needed it to have a nice day at the beach. Greatly appreciated
9609980,John,March,2022,Wonderful hosts and great unit!
9609980,Samuel,March,2022,Really awesome if you love Rincon you are gonna love this place. We celebrated our a anniversary  and we are definitely come back to rent the whole place. This the bes host you‚Äôre gonna get in Rincon. Vanesa she is the best. This is the kind of vibe your want it from Rincon here.
9609980,Kade,March,2022,Great place to stay! A little off the beaten path but everything is so close it doesn't even feel far. Roof is amazing! So close to surf beaches if that matters.
9609980,Don,March,2022,Quaint room with all the amenities.  used the beach chairs one day. and the rooftop was really cool. wish we'd have taken advantage of it more!  close to isle√±as restaurant. yoga. and steps beach for some kickass snorkeling.  And host Vanessa super sweet!
9609980,J.M.,February,2022,Perfect spot to enjoy the views. Super quiet and awesome host. Very easy and awesome communication.
9609980,James,January,2022,Great spot for a quick stay in Rincon. Would definitely come back. Perfect for traveling surfer.

Vanessa was super helpful with great ideas about what to do and was very communicative throughout the whole process from booking to check out. She is a lovely person. Her place was so peaceful and beautiful and we would recommend it to anyone. The rooftop is to die for!
9609980,Page,December,2021,The Boarding house is a beautiful and calming place to stay and it gives off such a chill vibe. It is in a great location. close to beaches. restaurants. and stores. Vanessa is an amazing host and keeps everything so clean with a true beachy boho feel. Parking is easily accessible! They have everything you need and don‚Äôt want to travel with. such as coolers. beach chairs. and even essential oil diffusers. Perfect place to get away and relax.
9609980,Arun Tej,December,2021,Beautiful location. very close to restaurants and beautiful beaches.Enjoyed our stay and beautiful view from the house
9609980,Tracy,December,2021,The Boarding House was perfect. It had everything I needed and was as pictured/described in the listing. The rooftop is gorgeous! Close to everything in Rincon. I would definitely stay here again.
9609980,Matthew,November,2021,Vanessa's place is a great little oasis near Rincon. The Seaglass Suite is a bit small. but if you are planning to be out and about. it is not an issue. The location is great. about a 15 minute walk to the nearest beach (or much less if you are driving). The standout attraction is the roofdeck on the property. It has amazing views and is extremely peaceful. Would definitely recommend for all who are interested in checking out this part of Puerto Rico.
9609980,Brendan,November,2021,Fantastic !! Everyone needs to book here
9609980,Ivelisse,August,2021,If you're looking for a relaxing and quiet stay away from the noise of the main Rincon area but not being too far away from it either. this is it! The Seaglass room was lovely. The A/C works great. and it offers a view of the trees and forest near the house. In a 10 minute drive. you are near food and drinking places. We definitely recommend this place!
9609980,Maria,August,2021,Great experience - my boyfriend and I enjoyed the stay. We rented Seaglass.  The place is conveniently located at Rincon close to beaches and restaurants. I loved room design. the rooftop with the view to the ocean was amazing! Small fridge and coffee maker were a great plus. Vanessa was prompt to answer all questions that we had. Would definitely recommend the place :)
9609980,Micah,August,2021,Vanessa is a great host! Loved staying with her!
9609980,Alex,July,2021,The sound of the birds and the Coqui was beyond relaxing. The view was spectacular. Clean. quiet.  organized and comfortable. A lot of food and entertainment close by. Would combe back.
9609980,Response from Vanessa,July,2021,Thanks for the review Andrea! I apologize that there were insects in the shower. The rooms get very thoroughly cleaned and checked before people arrive. but some things are just impossible being that we are surrounded by the jungle. Also. it is definitely a small room. and we do make that super clear on the listing so that everyone is aware prior to booking. I‚Äôm glad that you enjoyed the rooftop space and your time here at the house.Show more
9609980,Dannela M,July,2021,Clean and lovely space to get some rest and quiet time. Good communication with the host.

Good air conditioning. hot water. a little fridge. etc‚Ä¶ The terrace at the third floor is exactly what you see in the photos. just heavenly. Prepare to spend a lot of time up there‚Ä¶ is beautiful when is sunny. is beautiful when it rains. If you like reading. is a great spot. Vanessa the host is super sweet and communication with her was very easy.
9609980,Response from Vanessa,June,2021,Thanks for the review Diana. Yes termite season here happens during May into July. and when it rains in the evening. they are attracted to light and can get in from the outside. We do have notes up in all of the rooms about this situation so our guests are aware. I‚Äôm sorry you experienced this!Show more
9609980,Response from Vanessa,May,2021,Hi Miriam. I‚Äôm sorry you felt it was deceiving. We are located a 1/2 mile from Sandy beach. and it‚Äôs about a 3 minute drive from the house. The other popular beaches are within a 7-10 min. drive. We don‚Äôt advertise that we are located on the beach. Also there is a large rooftop terrace that is shared by all of the guests. We also make that very clear in our listing. that it is a community space available for everyone.Show more

Loved starting and ending our day at the gorgeous  roof top with the beautiful view! Calm and safe neighborhood. Thanks Vanessa & Greg!
9609980,Mollie,March,2021,Beautiful rooftop. thoughtfully designed for various occasions including lights. grill. picnic area. lounge area in shade. hammock. and sun bathing chairs. Vanessa was quick to respond and very helpful. Room itself was small. and need a car for the location (book in advance) Taxis are unreliable. Thoughtful touches such as oil diffuser. No shampoo or body wash. WiFi was sometimes spotty. and filtered water accessible to guests to refill themselves would be useful. Overall. no complaints - great experience. perfect location. accommodating hosts - stay was exactly as written in Vanessa‚Äôs post.
9609980,Response from Vanessa,March,2021,Thank you for the review. We do have all of our amenities updated on our listing. so I apologize if it wasn‚Äôt clear that you needed to bring your own personal toiletry items. We do provide hand soap for the bathroom.

I found the posted signs to be helpful and ensure the quality of the bnb remains in tip-top shape! Vanessa was very helpful and responded quickly when we had questions.

The bed and pillows were great. haven‚Äôt had a good nights sleep in a while and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for something more comfortable than that. Also having the mini fridge and cooler in the room really came in handy to keep our drinks cold. If you go to Rincon and are looking for a crash pad for 1-2 people this is the spot. Cheers!

Tv was old school. but it had basic cable...You won‚Äôt need it because there is lot‚Äôs to do in Rincon! The only down side is the parking. its a little inconvenient but we managed to always find a spot. Vanessa and Greg were super nice. We are definetly coming back soon!
9609980,Will,March,2018,Vanessa was a lovely host and took great care to ensure that we were had access to everything that we need. It's a nice quiet space with an amazing roof. and it's only about a 15-20 minute walk to the Sandy Beach area. Thanks again!
9609980,James,March,2018,What an amazing place to stay. The house was such a relaxing and beautiful environment. only topped by the incredible owners Vanessa and Greg. The views are absolutely stunning. especially from the expansive rooftop deck. I would highly recommend this rental over any other place in the Rincon area. I've stayed at quite a few other places around the area in the same price range and nothing compared to this place. Don't pass up the opportunity to stay here. If you're looking for relaxation and positive vibes. this is the place for you. If I could give it 10 stars. I would.
9609980,Jacobo,February,2018,Excellent hospitality and cleanliness!!
9609980,Keri,February,2018,Thank you for an wonderful stay! Vanessa is an incredibly welcoming host and we appreciated her flexibility with check in and check out. She provided plenty of information on nearby places to go and eat. which was helpful. Her place is gorgeous -- it's quiet with a beautiful roofdeck. perfect for morning coffee and all day/evening relaxing. We loved it. And in case anybody is wondering. there is power and water and we did not have any issues with either. Everything was perfect. Thank you again!
9609980,Chooch,July,2017,Vanessa's place was so cute and perfect for our two night stay in Rincon! It was close to the beach. and to some bars and restaurants in town! We loved the view on the top. and it was perfect for morning coffee or late night beers! It was super safe and quiet and I recommend staying here! Vanessa and Lola were both so sweet. I am SO happy with our time here! Thanks so much Vanessa for everything!
9609980,Tanya,April,2017,Great affordable place to stay in Rincon! I would definitely stay again.
9609980,Pamela,April,2017,This was a great location with plenty to do in the area. Vanessa gave us a free upgrade to the Pineapple room because the larger apartment was available which was very kind of her!   The roof top terrace was amazing with gorgeous views of the ocean!! It was a perfect spot to hang out and relax in the hammocks. Everything was clean and spotless and Vanessa was very responsive anytime we had a question. I  hope to return soon to Puerto Rico and I would definitely stay at the Boarding House again! Thank you for a wonderful stay Vanessa!!
9609980,Will,March,2017,We had a great time at the Boarding House! Vanessa and Greg and their dog Lola were the best hosts that you could ask for. I highly recommend staying with them.  The rooftop deck is definitely a highlight!
9609980,Kelly,March,2017,Vanessa was an amazing host. Super friendly. gave us great recommendations and was super hospitable!  We stayed in the Seaglass room and it was perfect for two!  Equipped with a view in the room and on the rooftop!Thanks again Vanessa. I will definitely recommend your place to anyone I know staying in Rincon
9609980,Andrew,March,2017,Great spot - quick drive to great surfing beaches and to town. Awesome roof deck.
9609980,Mary Ellen,February,2017,I had so much fun staying at the The Boarding house. the rooftop views of the ocean were amazing. Vanessa was a wonderful host and I can't wait to come back.
9609980,Indre,January,2017,We had a great stay at Vanessa's - loved the rooftop. and her suggestions of where to go out. Very nice. comfortable place!
9609980,Marcin,May,2016,The place is exactly as pictured. clean and comfortable. Vanessa was always quick to respond. offered helpful suggestions and made sure I have everything I need. The place is in nice quiet area. ~10 min walk from the beach. The rooftop with hammocks. couches. grill etc is a great place to hang out and spend the afternoon.
9609980,Chris,April,2016,Comfortable setting with a beautiful view.  Had a great stay and would love to come back!  The rooftop hammocks and views were the highlight!
9609980,Response from Vanessa,March,2016,Hernan. I love your positive energy and its always wonderful when a guest loves the place like we do and notices the little things I do to make it just right. THANK YOU! Hope to see you back soon Show more
9609980,Response from Vanessa,April,2016,Angela. I am so happy that you two ladies enjoyed your time here! You were a pleasure to host and I look forward to having you back again. Thank you so much!
9609980,Response from Vanessa,March,2016,Thanks so much Sebastian! Next time you'll have to stay longer. :)
9609980,Response from Vanessa,April,2016,Katie thank you so much for the fantastic review! I loved having you guys stay here and would welcome you back anytime!!
9609980,Jenna,February,2016,We absolutely loved this place! Vanessa and Greg are super friendly and helpful. we immediately felt right at home. Bonus was Lulu. a sweet old girl dog to greet you when you come home. All our dreams came true on the magical rooftop. where we enjoyed our morning fruit and played music in the evening with our new friends under the spectacular full moon. Rincon is charming and we loved the location of the boarding house. We stayed in the Spyglass Studio. which was very nice and clean but quite small. It was fine for us since we spent most of our time enjoying the roof. but if you want to make meals or spend any amount of time I'd recommend getting a larger room. It is a little tricky to find. look for the white tractor tire off the 413 (near the Lazy Parrot). Vanessa was very helpful in getting us there. call her if you need directions. She also has great recommendations for things to do and places to eat in the area. We can't wait to return!
9609980,Laine,February,2016,Loved our stay at the boarding house! The room had a beautiful view of the ocean and was super close to great restaurants and beaches. Vanessa was very sweet and welcoming. we would definitely recommend staying here!!
9609980,Response from Vanessa,February,2016,Thanks for all the kind words Ryan! I look forward to having you both come back very soon.
9609980,Response from Vanessa,January,2016,Thank you Christian! It was a pleasure hosting you and Cristi and I hope to see you again soon.

20591288,Response from Jennifer,December,2022,Always welcome
20591288,Dayna,November,2022,We stayed in Rincon for 3 nights at the end of our trip to Puerto Rico and this was our favourite accommodation of the whole two weeks. Bathtub and outside deck was so beautiful and relaxing. Highly recommend to anyone considering booking.
20591288,Javier,November,2022,Great weekend getaway for couples. Clean. spacious and cozy. Nice outdoor deck with relaxing bathtub. Easy access. safe and quiet neighborhood.
20591288,Hector,November,2022,Tub was great. bed comfortable and great space. Great communication with the host
20591288,Nicole,October,2022,It‚Äôs beautiful. we had a great time.
20591288,Travis,October,2022,Enjoy our stay would love to go back thank you again
20591288,Daphne,September,2022,The living space was nice and very open but the wifi didn‚Äôt work at all. Everything took forever to load and based on the names of the wifi. it seems like extenders are used for the rooms which may have impacted the connectivity issues. Bathroom appeared clean. however. the towels and sheets in the room had some stains on them. Otherwise it was a beautiful space and had a nice closet setup. You get your own driveway for one car that pulls right up to the door which was very convenient. Overall a good stay. wish we could have taken advantage of some of the amenities a bit more
20591288,Emily,September,2022,Beautiful location and place! Would stay here in a heartbeat again! It was near beautiful beaches and was located in a very peaceful neighborhood! Only issue I had was that the bathroom window didn't lock (lock was broken) so that did cause some safety concerns. however. the area was very safe and thankfully we didn't have any issues due to this. Rincon is definitely a beautiful place and would recommend going to beaches like Playa Buye and Playa Pe√±a Blanca!
20591288,Ivan,August,2022,Great spot! Everything is on point!!!
20591288,Julio,August,2022,place was nice and very clean.  super close a good spot to grab food and watch the sunset.  we loved it!
20591288,Whitnee,August,2022,Absolutely loved the place. I just wish it was closer to San Juan.
20591288,Laura,August,2022,We recommend Jennifer‚Äôs place. It is very spacious and super cute. This place is conveniently close to the town square where you can find small shops and places to grab a drink or a meal. If you choose to stay make sure you go to the Beach House (just down the road) for a sunset dinner.
20591288,Chaigna,August,2022,Lovely place to stay. Very clean and cozy.
20591288,Liamarys,August,2022,Everything was great. beautiful place near the most beautiful beaches of Puerto Rico.
20591288,Kaleb,August,2022,Great location. easy to get to all the restaurants shops. and beaches. Unit 1 exceeded all our expectations.
20591288,Response from Jennifer,August,2022,Hi. We are sorry for the circumstances that were out of our control and the refund was processed the same day through Airbnb but it might take some business days for it to show in your account.    ThanksShow more
20591288,Joann,July,2022,Great location!
20591288,Samantha,July,2022,Beautiful place!
20591288,Kayla,July,2022,Beautiful and spacious! Location is great. but the private patio was to die for. Wish we could have stayed longer!
20591288,Kaylie,July,2022,Truly magical! We were only in for two nights. but it was amazing. The tub was a luxury for sure! So worth it! And they do a great job keeping it super clean. No bugs inside or outside. Very peaceful. I highly recommend!
20591288,Nashali,July,2022,We were totally delighted. nothing was needed! You can go without towels/beach towel. They have good coffee and sugar. And everything is as in photos. I recommend that you bring bath soapü´∂üèΩ That‚Äôs it.
20591288,Kevin,June,2022,Great experience. excelent location. Totally recommended!
20591288,Laura,June,2022,We had an amazing time at Jennifer‚Äôs apartment. It was as described and very clean. The bed was comfortable. the shower was lovely. and the apartment was accessible. You can‚Äôt beat the location - five minutes or less from the best beaches in Rincon and ton of activities. Don‚Äôt miss the sunset from The Beach House just down the road. It‚Äôs magical and the food is great. Thanks for having us! We will definitely recommend to friends visiting the area.
20591288,Response from Jennifer,June,2022,In our 12 years of being Airbnb host. we can say this has been the most disrespectful guest we had had. Intentionally punching the TV not once. but twice. A total shame to the beautiful Airbnb community.
20591288,George,May,2022,This is a 1 bedroom rental.  Back deck with tub is very romantic.  Beach and bars are close by. very short drive.
20591288,Demar,May,2022,Such a wonderful and beautifully decorated apartment! the location was excellent very closet the beach and nice places to eat.  Also very thoughtful of Jennifer to provide beach towels and a chair. The apartment was very clean and the highlight was the outdoor private balcony with tub. We felt like we were in our own outdoor oasis. it was absolutely beautiful. We would highly recommend staying here. It's a fantastic place for couples if visiting Rincon!!
20591288,Kelli,May,2022,We absolutely loved this Airbnb. The location. the parking spot right in the front. and the tub! Only wish we would've stayed there longer!
20591288,Patricia,May,2022,lovely place and location. appreciated the extra romantic touches. definitely book!
20591288,Gerardo J,May,2022,Excellent location 20/10. 5 minute drive to beaches and restaurants.  Cozy apartment. I will book again soon.
20591288,Beth,May,2022,Great Place! - place was as described - very clean - location was good. close to a lot of Rincon‚Äôs activities - super cute getaway
20591288,Matt,May,2022,"A nice experience. Location is a very short drive to the beaches. Medium walk to the ""beach house"" restaurant which is probably one of the more consistently open places  (I'd drive anyway. not a lot of sidewalks).Bath was surprisingly awesome. plenty of warm water. electricity reliable for the 3 nights we were there.Perfect place for sleeping and cleaning up. you should be spending your time at the beach anyway! next time we'll try to get a room with a pool. üòäDecent amount of mosquitoes around the area and they can sneak in around the doors even when closed. got bit more indoors than I did outdoors."
20591288,Theo,May,2022,Great place much larger than photos make it seem. and that bath is amazing!
20591288,Carlos,May,2022,great place!!
20591288,Marisol,May,2022,Perfect spot for a couple. Close to everything. Very clean with lots of personal details! 10+

20591288,Derek,April,2022,Great stay. very accurate. Highly recommend
20591288,Nicole,April,2022,10/10 I can‚Äôt even express how gorgeous this place and everything around it is. I recommended bringing misquito spray because you‚Äôre going to want to keep those doors open to hear the frogs and birds at night. There‚Äôs so many tiny details that made this trip amazing like the guest book where people made their recommendations and her own book that she has. Also actual books all over to read in the tub. Water gets hot hot which is amazing. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciated everything our host offered to us.
20591288,Habib,April,2022,Very nice place in a quiet neighborhood. Close to lots of beaches/attractions. Recommended.
20591288,Response from Jennifer,April,2022,"Sheila as we explained the issue was ""fixed"" but got damaged again so we ordered a new hot water heather which will be installed tomorrow as in the island things are not that easy to find. We process a compensation for the inconvenience to you. THanksShow more"

20591288,Adriana,April,2022,Beautiful place to stay it!! It's clean and so cozy. with all the amenities needed for uour stay! The communication with the host was excellent! My husband and I will definitely return!
20591288,Response from Jennifer,April,2022,Thanks for staying with us. Our rules clearly specify no visitors as we like to respect the privacy for the other guests in the property and more importantly avoid issues with our neighbors as we like to be considerate with them and will not apologize for that.Show more
20591288,Jen,March,2022,A little slice of heaven. The back deck was amazing and I soaked in that beautiful tub for hours. Everything was beautiful. the only thing wrong was that we only had one night there and not more! Was a short drive from the beach and was easy to find. Would highly recommend.

20591288,Damian,March,2022,Amazing spot to relax and unwind!
20591288,Catherine,March,2022,My wife and I stayed at 7 different Airbnbs. on a recent trip. Jennifer's place was stay number 5.  I do not even know where to begin. The pictures do this accommodation no justice. It is beautiful. so spacious.  and impeccably clean. From the moment we walked in the door. there are so many personal touches. that put this place over the top. The smell that envelopes you upon entering the apartment reminds you of home. The living room/kitchen is beautiful. impeccably styled. comfortable. and welcoming. The couch is so inviting. A blanket placed over the arm made me want to curl up and relax. after a long day of beaches. There is a beautiful full length mirror that begs to be featured in Instagram selfies. The bathroom has a fantastic rain shower head. As if all of this wasn't enough. the true crown jewel of this place is the bedroom. With ample storage. it is appointed as beautifully as the rest of the place. Jennifer left a romantic tray filled with flowers. champagne glasses. a candle. matches. a reed difusser. room spray. and a beautiful hand written note. welcoming us. The back porch. off of the bedroom is a lovers paradise with a beautiful soaking tub and a hammock big enough for two. On the rooftop is a beautiful seating area and an incredible view. Words do not describe how beautiful and romantic this place is. We will definitely be booking with Jennifer again. I cannot recommend this Airbnb enough. You will not be dissapointed.Show more
20591288,Allison,March,2022,Lovely place and we felt safe and comfortable here. Jennifer was quick to respond when we had trouble checking in. She also brought over a brand new coffee maker when I let her know the one there wasn‚Äôt working. The outdoor tub and back porch were a nice treat! You‚Äôll fall asleep to the sound of tree frogs and wake up to quite a few roosters but it was great. It was a short walk down to the Beachhouse for dinner and drinks which is a lively place. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
20591288,Adrian,March,2022,My wife and I want to thanks you for such a great experience. Your property was truly amazing.
20591288,Alyssa,February,2022,When we arrived late at night it appeared that the apartment hadn‚Äôt been cleaned after the previous guest checked out. After I messaged her the next morning. Jennifer did send someone over to clean. Besides this issue. we had a great time at the apartment and really appreciated hanging out in the back patio area.
20591288,Melanie,February,2022,The apartment is perfectly located and the Check in was super easy. The apartment was clean and super cozy. We loved the back deck with the hammock and tub. We will definitely come back! 100% recommended

20591288,Lisa,February,2022,My fianc√© and I loved our stay at the tropical suites.  It was cute. clean. and located walking distance to maria‚Äôs and Sandy beach.  Cant wait to come back and stay there again
20591288,Wanmar√≠s,January,2022,Great. cozy place! Close to restaurants. Nice for couples.
20591288,Christian,January,2022,Great place. even better than the pictures.
20591288,Ekaterina,January,2022,It's a really pretty place in a wonderful location! The Beach House restaurant nearby was exceptional. I had the best vegan tacos of my life there! Also. Rincon is great to go snorkeling over a coral reef. However. this Airbnb itself was not cleaned up before we arrived and we had very loud neighbors in the unit next door after 11 pm 2 nights/3 (which the hosts have no control over. of course). Also I know it might be important for some people: the wi-fi was weak when it worked at all. The hosts offered to bring clean linens and towels after we asked. so great communication!! Overall our stay was quite enjoyable!
20591288,Alicia,January,2022,The place was clean and near the lighthouse. We weren't able to get wifi to work but we survived since it was just one night. We really just used the place to sleep and shower but the neighbor was really friendly when we checked in. The roosters woke us up but we didn't mind. Overall it was a pretty good stay.
20591288,Christian,January,2022,Amazing place. literally 3 minutes from the lighthouse. bars and very close to restaurants. Been living all my life in Puerto Rico and this was my first time in Rinc√≥n and Jennifer‚Äôs place was super. I totally recommend to stay in this place. Very comfortable. clean. super spacious and romantic. Thank you! ü•á
20591288,Larken,January,2022,I loved this spot! I took myself on a beautiful retreat with the ocean and this was an incredible place to call home for a couple days. The back porch with the bathtub and hammock was definitely the highlight‚Ä¶
20591288,Jolene,January,2022,This airbnb was an enjoyable stay. The check in was easy. and the beaches are a walkable distance away (around 15 to 20 minutes). The highlight for us was definitely the outdoor tub! It was very beautiful and relaxing. Plan on having a car when you stay here if you need to grocery shop. and remember to buy coffee/sugar/creamer as it is not included with the stay.
20591288,Carla,January,2022,We had a great experience at Jennifer's Airbnb. I am from San Juan. Puerto Rico and wanted to spend a few days in Rinc√≥n and the location was perfect -- minutes away (by car) from the best restaurants and beaches in Rinc√≥n. Airbnb was very spacious and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Private parking was a plus!
20591288,Madeline,December,2021,Enjoyed our stay in Rincon! The suite was very clean and had nice little details like candles and a card that made it feel welcoming and homey. There was plenty of space to spread our stuff around. and the air conditioner worked well. which was a breath of fresh air (ha) after being in the hot city and rainforest. Jennifer is a very accommodating and responsive host and does what she can to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Only minor issue is that the hot water ran out pretty quickly in both the shower and tub.Response from JenniferJanuary 2022Thanks! We are installing new water heather this month.
20591288,Response from Jennifer,January,2022,Thanks! We are installing new water heather this month.

20591288,Priyakshi,November,2021,Location is good for the Airbnb but the amenities were very avg/ poor.. no hot water and coffee is 12$ with no filter or sugar available. AC is loud and doesn‚Äôt really cool the room. Not sure why I was paying cleaning fee if I had to take out the trash and clean up dishes etc. Anyways it‚Äôs a pretty Airbnb if you want an insta kinda stay.
20591288,Selamile,November,2021,Great location - close to restaurants and ample things to do in Rincon! Would book a longer stay next time. Also. loved the private note they left for us as we checked in. On the flip side. wish there was better customer service & communication from the host especially since it was our first time visiting Puerto Rico; responses usually came within business hours but were often shorter / less helpful than we've experienced through individual hosts. Also feels slightly overpriced but would stay again now that I have more experience with Rincon and PR.
20591288,Desiree,November,2021,This unit was absolutely welcoming and beautiful. We had been traveling for a week already budget style and were ready for a nice relaxing place. This was definitely a treat. The back deck is just as relaxing and amazing as described and pictured. Allow some time in your trip to chill back there a bit. The roof is also really nice for sunsets. Parking was great. We had our own spot right in front of the unit. We were happy to use the coffee maker. fridge. TV with Roku. beach towels and beach chairs. Town is a quick drive down the hill to restaurants. bars. etc. We loved Rincon and will be back. Thank you!
20591288,Noelia,November,2021,We love the space! It was quiet. relaxing. and private. The location was perfect. a short drive to everything (beach. restaurants. bakery. etc.). We loved the vegetation in the back balcony and the privacy of it. Jennifer always responded to our messages very quickly. We will definitely stay here again!

20591288,David,October,2021,What a wonderful getaway to stay at. Me and the lady enjoyed this nice. quiet. super clean. relaxing and homey stay here. Highly recommended for a weekend to a few weeks getaway from the hustle and noise of the city life and enjoy the beach...the food....and the home. Especially that wonderful bathtub outside. Will be staying here again whenever possible.
20591288,Tina,October,2021,Had a perfect stay here. Just as pictured! The bathtub on the porch with the string lights was so beautiful. The place was extremely clean and had extra things for the beach. Would 10/10 recommend staying here.

20591288,Rafael,August,2021,Awesome place. near beaches. bars and restaurants! Perfect for getting to know the west coast of Puerto Rico or just relaxing in the private deck. Will definitely try to go back!
20591288,Response from Jennifer,August,2021,I hope you are able to come at a later time.
20591288,Alonso And Rocio,August,2021,Not only was this place just as beautiful as the pictures but the tub outside really brought it all together and made it such a magical experience. The location was perfect! About 8 minutes from art walk (which happens every Thursday) and 2 minutes from our new favorite spot (the beach house) where you can enjoy delicious Bloody Mary and vegan nachos! 10/10

20591288,Response from Jennifer,July,2021,Hi! During your stay there were power outages on the whole town affecting over 13.000 residents.

20591288,Tori,May,2021,You Have to stay here! Gorgeous little place. the patio was our favorite. There is an info booklet with lots of things to do. Very close to restaurants and beaches. There are beach chairs you can use. Kitchen has microwave and portable stove top as well as silverwear and pans/pots
20591288,Caren,May,2021,Great and lovely stay. It was a little confusing at first to find the right unit because the photos focused on another entrance. Regardless. the private deck was spectacular. The prettiest sunsets could be seen from the roof.
20591288,Carlos,April,2021,Beautiful stay. it is close to everything! Has nice touches and is very welcoming. Would definitely stay again.
20591288,Orlianie Itzel,April,2021,Great days we had!

20591288,Joseph,April,2021,As our first Airbnb experience. we just had a blast with this place. The host thought about every single aspect ahead of time. as we just couldn't find anything to complain about. The area was peaceful. clean. smelled great and I really wish we had stayed more days. Also. the decorations. the small details. and the relaxing vibe the place offers are just what you would want for some vacations. The inclusion of the tub was a huge selling point as well. and it didn't disappoint. We will surely stay here again when we go back to Rincon.
20591288,Natacha,April,2021,Everything was great. Very nice place to relax as a couple.
20591288,Michael,April,2021,Amazing place to stay for a short getaway. Great location and beautiful house. Accurate description and definitely bigger than what pictures show. Had a great time and Jennifer was a very responsive and great host.

20591288,Hannah,April,2021,You MUST stay here. especially if you are a couple. This place was very clean and had everything you would need. My favorite feature was the private deck with the beautiful bathtub. We enjoyed many baths throughout our stay and enjoyed the privacy of the deck. Also the shower is super nice with a large shower head. The location is awesome. in 5 - 10 minute driving distance to anything you want to do in Rincon. My only regret is not staying at this place longer. it was spectacular.
20591288,Courtney Nicole,April,2021,It‚Äôs clean. the tub is a nice touch. and the place met all my needs! Jennifer is very responsive as well. I would definitely recommend.

20591288,Daniel,March,2020,Jennifer's communication was great. and she sent us many local suggestions. The private tub on the back deck was lovely. The bed was on the smaller side. but the AC in the bedroom worked well and the bathroom was elegant and clean. The living room faces the road. so there was some noise from passing cars. but the bedroom is set further back and stayed quiet. Thanks for a nice stay!

We only stayed here one night but all the amenities were there for us to make our stay very special.   Parking literally in front of the door and a/c that cools down the bedroom very quickly.   We would definitely stay there again!!

Stayed with my husband and we both loved the romantic touch of amenities: candles. oils. bath liquid soap. and of course the tub. We did a photoshoot and we are so happy with the outcomes. There were binders for recommendations. games and Netflix. Kept us entertained on our downtime. We played chess while watching a fun Netflix series. Very sweet spot to stay. we would return for sure.
20591288,Dileny,September,2019,Wonderful unit with cute touches and the outdoor bath tub is great. Very clean as well. Would recommend for couples.

20591288,Jennifer,June,2019,Terrific clean modern space in the hills.  Charming private outdoor space. Very comfy bed and big. clean bath.  Importantly. the apartment stayed cool with the shades drawn. despite the summer heat.  Only needed to use AC at a minimum.  Also. no flying bug bites!  (important to some members of my family).  And when I lost my phone/credit cards. the office was terrific at communicating with neighbors to recover my essentials.

20591288,Gabriela,February,2019,Amazing location in Rinc√≥n close to all the best spots ‚ú®
20591288,Jonathan,February,2019,This property is immaculately clean modern and its amenities made it very cozy. The hostess went out of her way to make sure that I was comfortable. I would definitely recommend this home to anyone visiting Puerto Rico
20591288,Tom,February,2019,In the heart of a Rincon neighborhood.  You must try the rooftop gazebo to watch the stars.  Conveniently close to Puntas Surf Shop (a block away) and a short walk to the Beach House Restaurant and Bar (amazing views of the sunset).  Host was available and responsive to questions/needs.  My first AirBnbn Puerto Rico and they lived up to the standards here.
20591288,Emilie,February,2019,Well located. clean condo unit near the best beaches in Rincon!
20591288,Gaby,February,2019,Great location. clean and comfortable. Great views. Super easy check-in/out. Jennifer was super responsive and very helpful suggesting great places. Will definitely stay again.
20591288,Juan,February,2019,The apartment was much more than I expected. The surroundings were immaculate and well maintained. The location to enjoy the nightlife is excellent. I have nothing negative to comment. I recommend it.
20591288,Melissa,February,2019,We had a great stay here. It is very centrally located. and comes with a great and well thought out guide book to give you a suggestion for anything you could want to do or see here in Rincon. The apartment was very clean and spacious. There was a good view from the roof top patio area. There was also a free alarm clock. the roosters in the neighborhood as well as the cats. however. we did not mind this. Having parking right out front of the door was a perk as well!
20591288,Kortni,February,2019,Such a beautiful. unique spot! Would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Rincon.
20591288,Meegan,January,2019,Apartment was clean and large. Location is great.
20591288,Marq,January,2019,This air bnb is a very cute Puerto Rico experience. I loved being able to sit outside on the hammock in the morning and at night soaking in the Puerto Rico air. If you have a hard time sleeping becasue of noise. warning the roosters are up very early! And they are very loud from 5am until 10am. It was entertaining for my stay and did not interrript my sleep. But if you need peace and quite. this may not be for you

I am already planning another trip and looking to book this place again for a longer period of time.  Rincon is the best place in Puerto Rico I have found thus far.  A gem in Puerto Rico.   Thanks to Jennifer for all the help and tips.  Information has been the most descriptive of all my trips in my time using Airbnb.  I can only say thanks and see you soon...
20591288,Response from Jennifer,November,2018,Tropical Suites at 413 has 3 parking spots areas. enough to fit all cars for all guests. Luis' arrived at 12:30 a.m. and found that the parking spot across from his unit was being occupied. He called me at 12:30 where I was obviously sleeping so I picked up the phone at 12:34 am and told him that he could park anywhere he liked. I am not sure what else he expected at that time! Clearly. issues were solved during non-laboral hours plus he got a free late checkout.Show more
20591288,Mariel,November,2018,This was a great place to stay! It was private. spacious and convenient. The details definitely put this place over the top. The balcony with the hammock was a wonderful surprise. A great place to relax and experience local life.

20591288,Satyam,August,2018,Our Tropical Suites apartment was great‚Äî very spacious. private & conveniently close to several beaches. The room had nice touches such as beach supplies. a helpful booklet of local things to do and a patio with a scenic view. The only inconvenience to note was an issue with the power. which repeatedly went out for several hours at a time. multiple times. on our final night. But overall. the stay was still a good experience and I would recommend it.
20591288,Mustafa,July,2018,Jennifer's place was beautiful and we wish we could've stayed longer. The Airbnb has some breathtaking views along with some great amenities. It was located near great restaurants. bars and shops making it very convenient to get to and back to the Airbnb.I would highly recommend this Airbnb!

It was really clean and big for two people. lots of room. We stayed two nights but we definelty recommend to stay a little bit longer in Rincon to discover it. Thanks Jennifer!
20591288,Response from Jennifer,May,2018,Thanks for staying with us.  Come back soon.

20591288,Response from Jennifer,March,2018,Always welcome.
20591288,Response from Jennifer,March,2018,Haylee. since the storm we requested new doors for the property so the noise between units is not an issue but they have not arrived. As soon as they do this will stop being an issue. Thanks.
20591288,Response from Jennifer,March,2018,Carlos. I am sorry you had than impression about our property. however if you would have taken the time to read the property description and amenities you would have notice that neither WiFi or TV are offered since the storm as the services has not been restored to the area yet. It is very wrong of you to write a bad review about an amenity that was not offered. It's like if I rented a house and then complain because there was no pool when nowhere said there was!  About the water. the cleaning lady cleaned all the day of your arrival and the day before and there is running water. Not sure exactly what was the issue.   Again. I advise you to read well the property descriptions before booking to avoid this type of reviews that affect hosts.   ThanksShow more
20591288,Thomas,March,2018,"Everything was amazing. but.... Don't know if it's always been their or if it came post Maria but the ""downstairs"" neighbor has a very big Rooster/Hen House with a LOT of a.m. singing Roosters. My wife and I went for a little relaxing weekend but got a bit of a surprise when at 4:30 in the morning we woke up to that symphony. Having that said. the communication with the owners/management was amazing. The location of the house could not be better (road 413). For the price. I think this is one of the BEST places to stay if you are going on an adventure or cool surf trip to Rincon. If you just want to get away and sleep in peace. maybe look at something else. But if you want to go surfing and hit the night life in Rincon. this is the place you want."
20591288,Nicole,March,2018,Get a real feel for Rincon by staying at Jennifer‚Äôs place. It is up the hill from the beaches (a 10-15 min walk) or a very quick drive. Being on the hill has major advantages. The home has windows that face the ocean from both the front and the back side. That means you get both sunrise and sunset views.We stayed here without a car and found it easy to talk to restaurants and beaches. The condo itself was super clean and just as advertised.
20591288,Alex,February,2018,The place and the view were amazing!

20591288,Ma,September,2017,Very great experience! The suite is nice and clean. with pretty decoration. It is like a home. The owner is very responsible and nice too. We recommend the suite with the private deck. it is awesome!
20591288,Wigberto,August,2017,The property is great. just as described.  The pool needed some maintenance. but everything else was very clean. decorated with very good taste and very comfortable. The location is ideal for a nice gateway.  Just a couple minutes drive to bars. restaurants. and to the beach.  I'm planning to stay in again for a scuba diving trip since diving shops are so close by.  Communication was excellent.  Had a really great time.  I would definitely recommend.

636849355154156335,Dex,December,2022,What a Rinconion Gem. I had an incredible stay here! Allison is a delightful host. and I look forward to booking again.
636849355154156335,Lina,July,2022,This place is so great. I was excited from the description and pictures but its even better in person. It‚Äôs beautiful. peaceful and very comfortable. The common areas are great too. Communication with Alison was so easy. I loved it and look forward to be back.
48148810,Jose,May,2022,Everything was amazing! I recommend the English Rose without hesitation!
48148810,Cara,April,2022,Loved our stay in the Isabela Suite.  Lovely room and a stellar view. just like it looks in the pictures.  Not sure how English Rose does it--they run a quiet. lovely guest house and a fantastic restaurant on a remote spot on the top of a hill without a hitch.
48148810,Ada,March,2022,Excellent. very clean. great accommodations. cozy. perfect for a romantic retreat‚Ä¶ we love the place!!!
48148810,Yanna,March,2022,This place was a dream. It was very clean and modern. and matched the theme of the environment perfectly. All the staff was very courteous and friendly. and quick to help. The location was absolutely gorgeous. We had a poolside view. which overlooked the tropical forest as well as the ocean in the distance. The food at the restaurant. especially the breakfast. was spectacular. Great getaway if you want to just relax. and enjoy a gorgeous tropical environment.
48148810,Lucia,February,2022,This is a beautiful and magical place to stay. It was very clean and so pretty. Beautiful view. good food. great hospitality. it‚Äôs close to the beach. great restaurants and shops. Recommended 100%
48148810,Chris,January,2022,Perfect place to stay; unbelievable pool and a brunch spot that will never be topped.
48148810,Liz,December,2021,Nice place !!
48148810,Emma,November,2021,We stayed in Isabela suite and it was perfect! Clean and nice with a lot of space. Staff was so kind and accommodating - especially Michael at the restaurant. Our only call out is that it is noisy in the morning. There is water pipe that is for exporting water next to room and the kitchen cooking up the amazing breakfast (and the rooster crows well before dawn)! We are early risers so we weren‚Äôt bothered. but I would advise for noise machine or earplugs if you are looking to sleep in.
48148810,Qasim,November,2021,Great place.
48148810,Jessi,October,2021,An incredibly perfect place to stay. Pool is gorgeous. view is sublime. room is exactly what we wanted.
48148810,Lourdes,August,2021,Katie‚Äôs place was lovely!! We enjoyed it very much and stayed in the Isabella suite which had a gorgeous view!!! Road to location was a bit confusing and as mentioned a scary ride up & down the mountain. Room was also very comfortable and roomy for two and is as pictured. Breakfast at balcony was wonderful.
48148810,Jocelyn,August,2021,Everything was beautiful and wonderful. Highly recommended
48148810,Nabil,August,2021,Amazing views! Breakfast @ English Rose was delicious! I will definitely return!
48148810,Mimi,July,2021,This place was absolutely one of the best parts about our trip to Rincon. The room was clean and nicely decorated. We loved waking up to such an amazing view of the jungle and the Caribbean sea. We look forward to staying there again!
48148810,Liza,July,2021,If you want a cozy place near everything but at the same time away from the bustle this is your place.  Isabella room was comfortable and cozy. with a nice view to the ocean and a wall painted like seeing the sunlight from the bottom of the sea. The restaurant on-site with good food and welcoming staff (including Tiger King). Nice pool which can be used to do some laps.
48148810,Danitza,June,2021,Incredible view and room decor
48148810,Danielle,June,2021,Great stay with picturesque views. Super clean and friendly staff. The drive up is a little scary. but that‚Äôs the fun of driving in PR. The restaurant is only open 8am-12pm so most of the day the property is very low key and secluded. The only issue we had was a rooster waking us up at 2:30 one day and 4am the next. Bring your ear plugs and you will do fine!
48148810,Gurneet,June,2021,Thanks for a wonderful stay at The English Rose. Tranquil hotel with boho chic decor. stunning balcony views and a lovely quiet pool to hang out! Breakfast on the balcony a true highlight! Some small renovations taking place but a zen environment nonetheless. Recommend hiring a car as a very steep journey up
48148810,Alexander,May,2021,great pool and location
48148810,Nelson,April,2021,The room was gorgeous and spotless. The view was incredible. Definitely would recommend!
48148810,Jeffrey,April,2021,Absolutely spectacular view. stylish room.  wonderfully designee location. pool. and great service. There are only a few rooms so Im almost reluctant to give such huge shout out but this place deserves it.  We will be back!
48148810,Elsa,April,2021,Lovely room with amazing view to pool and sea. The pool was perfect for my swimming practice. Will stay again in the future.
48148810,Stephanie,April,2021,Amazing view and beautiful room. I would stay again soon
48148810,Lisandra,March,2021,I recommend this place all the way. from the beautiful space and views. to the amazing breakfast. super clean and safe  its close to the many beaches and restaurants Rincon has to offer. Can‚Äôt wait to go back again.
48148810,Janyse,July,2022,The view from the balcony and the decoration. comfort. excellent details. We would definitely come back. We didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant but  will be back so we could have that experience.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
48148810,Nicole,September,2021,It was exactly what it said in the publication. It has a beautiful view. good service and very comfortable. They have breakfast in the upper area and parking. It's more like a bus ride than a car if you need it.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
9901507,Andrew,March,2021,cool spot in a great location!!
9901507,Francisco,November,2020,Really nice place
9901507,Ricardo,August,2019,Very nice and private
9901507,Natalia,July,2019,You will not want to leave! This is a very cozy place near the beach. If you can get the jacuzzi for yourself by the morning or just near the nightfall. it‚Äôs truly relaxing. Overall. it‚Äôs a great price for what you get. A fully equipped kitchen and a very nice and comfortable bedroom. Though this specific room doesn‚Äôt have any type of view. you can always go outside and enjoy it. Plus. the staff was very nice. We will definitely be coming back! Kudos on the local recommendations.
9901507,Jamie Lee,December,2017,Everything was perfect. excellent place to relax and enjoy the Rincon vibes. Once again. thanks for every detail and attention provided.
9901507,Shamay77@Gmail.Com,March,2017,We came here from Chicago. We come one time per year and always like to stay on Puntas. This is an amazing place at an great price. The management is kind and helpful. but also gives you space if that is what you prefer. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable. You can walk to Sandy Beach. always the best bonus for us as surfers!! We will be back!
9901507,Jamie,February,2017,This was our first stay at serenity's  and it is a beautiful place! Close enough to walk to the beach. The apartment was clean. it would be nice if there was more kitchen utensils and baking dishes . The hot tub was a great place to meet other guest. The price is just right also! We had a great time in rincon once again and we will becoming back to serenity again next year!
9901507,Brianna,January,2017,Serenity is super close. walking distance to some great restaurants and nightlife spots ( sushi bar. tamboo. casa verde which had live music every day we were there. Jakes Java) Serenity is walking distance to some great beaches! (pools and sandy beach) The space is super clean. simple. rooms were large and just what we needed to be comfortable. Very happy with our stay here.
9901507,Cait,January,2017,Easy check-in. great location. clean and spacious! Beautiful space! I would definitely book here again :)
9901507,Daniel,January,2017,Spent the New Years weekend. like always it was a perfect getaway. I highly recommend staying here.
9901507,Lemuel,March,2016,The stay was amazing!! Peaceful. beautiful. and walking distance to the beach! Sara was amazing! Woulb visit again for sure!!
9901507,Julia,March,2016,Service: Sara's hospitality was 5-star quality. She's accommodating. helpful. friendly. She: - provided recommendations for beaches appropriate for a 15 month old - provided maps of the area and explained where recognizable landmarks were - provided anything we needed (i.e. can opener. beach towels. crib - we didn't use it since we had a pack 'n play but the thought counts) - let us use the laundry facility on site to wash our clothes - refunded 2 nights of our stay after we checked out early due to extenuating circumstances in spite of the 'Strict' no-refunds policy (not related to hotel itself. but rather the large. rowdy group who rented the room next to ours - had they not been staying here at the same time as us. we would not have left early)  Location: I was expecting a hotel within extremely easy walking distance to the beach. shops. and restaurants. While the hotel is close to these things as the crow flies (about .35 miles). what is not so obvious is the fact that in order to actually get down to the main street you have to walk down (and then eventually back up) an EXTREMELY steep hill. I am not exaggerating. My husband and I are 30 and fit. We are well traveled and have stayed at other beautiful hotels that involved walking up/down stairs/hills with no problem; however. we would not even attempt to walk down to the beach from this hotel as the climb back up was so steep.   Facility: - The pool is tiny. but adequate. We did not use it.  In fact. it shouldn't even be considered a pool. it was a hot tub. - 2 parking lots. one at the hotel itself and the other across the street  - Light breakfast is offered. but we did not take it - prepared breakfast using the stove in our room  Rooms (Suite 11): Pros: - Relatively spacious and modernly furnished  - Full Kitchen with updated appliances (full size fridge. microwave. stove/oven) - Separate bedroom with door - Netflix (via Roku) and free WiFi available in room - A/C throughout entire room  Cons: - Shower head looked shiny and new. but did not operate 100% - leaked a little.  - Bathroom lacked storage (small drawer under sink) - No wardrobe or closet in bedroom  - Cable not hooked up - Absolutely no windows facing anything you'd actually want to look at. dark; Windows were not transparent glass. they were opaque (barely translucent) and couldn't be opened because A/C would escape  Final thoughts: - Pictures of the room on this listing are accurate. If I stayed here again. it would be in Suite 10 or 6 as they have the best views - The only reason I would return to this hotel is Sara. - You need a car to stay here (to get here and then to get anywhere else after you check in).Show more
9901507,Mark,March,2016,Wife and I stayed at Serenity for almost a week. Had a very pleasant and relaxing room. Everything was in perfect shape and worked well. Looking forward to coming back. Thanks Sara!!
9901507,Christopher,February,2016,The accommodations where excellent. Clean and elegant. An excellent place to stay! Will definitely be back.
9901507,Mujtaba,January,2016,Serenity is everything you could ask if you are looking for peace and quiet. Most importantly. the people who work at Serenity make you feel welcomed as if you are family. I will be back again! Thanks again for the hospitality!
9901507,Andrea,January,2016,Sara was a gracious and helpful host. The propert was very clean and comfortable. My only complaint is there were a lot of younger guests staying on the property who made quite a bit of noise in the middle of the night.
9901507,Konstantin,January,2016,We stayed at Sirenity for a week. Sara. the office manager. made it clear that since they have opened just a month ago. they are still working on setting the place up. From the room description we were hoping to see the fully equipped kitchen. but it was still lacking a lot of common utensils. which Sara provided later on our request. This was the only downside to the room. Sirenity is at walking distance to the beach and a couple of restaurants. but the rental car is a must. We will definitely stay here again!
9901507,Fredrik,January,2016,I had an amazing stay at Serinity in Rincon (Punta Gorda). The host Laura was extremely nice and helpful. I stayed in two different apartments and both of them were top notch! Clean. comfortable and newly build.  I can warmly recommend a stay at Serenity!

44306268,Kim,November,2022,I can't say enough about Mary's place. it was perfect for our trip! Clean and spacious. amazing views from both patios. the two kitchens are well equipped with everything we needed. Being right on the beach was amazing. falling asleep to the sound of the ocean every night was so peaceful. My son enjoyed the boogie boards that were provided. I would highly recommend!
44306268,Carolyn,November,2022,We stayed at Casa Serrano to attend a wedding nearby. and it was everything we needed and more! Mary was responsive with all of the questions we had. The place was beautiful and we will definitely be returning.
44306268,Ingrid,October,2022,Breathtaking home and location! Perfect place to get your Zen on! Don't overthink it. just do it! The host is very responsive and accommodating. Everything you need is easily accessible.

44306268,John,May,2022,Perfect location and all the little extras you could possibly need to enjoy this beachfront amazing home.   The sunsets are free every night.  If you are are coming to Rinƒáon we highly recommend staying here.
44306268,Vilma,April,2022,You can expect a beautiful and tranquil environment at Casa Serrano. Yet. you are close to everything! The home is spacious and well appointed. The views are beautiful!
44306268,Matt,November,2021,This house is literally the definition of a relaxing beachfront get away. Spacious. well equipped home with thoughtful touches. comfortable bedrooms. a massive outdoor terrace to sit on and watch the sunset. and a gate that leads directly to the beach. It‚Äôs located in a nice quiet neighborhood that is still close to all Rincon has to offer and the only difficulty you‚Äôll have is making yourself leave. Mary was a delight and our group is already trying to plan out when we can return.
44306268,Response from Mary,September,2021,Thank you Edward! We will be happy to host your group once again!

44306268,Lindsey,April,2021,We had an amazing time in Rincon at Casa Serrano.   It was much bigger than expected. and we loved the comfortable style of the home. There were a couple of grocery stores nearby so we were able to cook easily. We had young children with us. so we were pleased that it was in a safe neighborhood. There was plenty of beach gear. so you only need to bring your swimsuit and sunblock. We would love to come back!!
44306268,Sarah,April,2021,Awesome stay! Beautiful!
44306268,Response from Mary,March,2021,Eva.  I‚Äôm glad enjoyed the ocean and beach view during your stay.   I wish you would have communicated that you couldn‚Äôt find a market nearby.  because we would have recommended Edward‚Äôs and Econo. 3 blocks away from our home at calle14 and 115 is Edward‚Äôs food market. also Econo is less then about a 1/2 mile away on 115.  Regard parking. although we don‚Äôt have on property parking we do have 50 feet of public street parking directly in front of our home. on Calle 8. where there is always parking available.

Everything was very clean and looks new. Remote control for AC and Ceiling Fans and lights in Bedroom and Living Room. Big modern refrigerator and Restaurant style gas stove.

33346944,Luis,February,2021,Nice place.
33346944,Nicole,January,2021,This was a great place to stay in Rincon if you want to see an incredible view every time you open the door. We stayed in Villa 3. Johnny was excellent at answering all my questions and making sure we got to the property safely. The property is VERY well taken care and has a great view of the ocean. Everything was very clean and all the amenities worked excellent. Less than 10 minutes from the plaza. beaches and many of the restaurants.
33346944,Amelia,January,2021,The place is super clean and the unit 3 has a pretty open view of the backyard and little bit of the ocean view far away. The sound at night is lovely and quiet. The unit 3 has no cel signal and their Wi-Fi doesn‚Äôt work if you are inside of the unit or barely work if you are outside on the balcony. So if you are planing on working it will be very challenging. There is a nice balcony on that unit so as unit 4. great for cocktails and morning coffee.  We had some issues with the shower . no hot water but they fixed after our third night there . The unit has basic things . the kitchen is simple ... no salt & pepper . seasoning or olive oil. So if you didn‚Äôt make to the grocery store the day before you won‚Äôt have coffee on the next morning . The parking is ok. a little tight but not bad when there are up to 3 cars. The bathroom is  cute . the a/c and fans are great . and the mattress is comfortable. The walk to the beach is on a steep road but great if you enjoy to walk and exercise and that take you to some great beaches.
33346944,Doel,July,2020,Lions Gate is an excellent choice when visiting Rincon. Clean. quiet. peaceful and surrounded by nature.100% recommended!!

33346944,Doel,October,2019,We booked 3 of annettes casitas. Having stayed in the Little Red House and knowing the properties were kept remarkably clean. I invited 4 friends over to rincon for a long weekend getaway. The casitas were great. excellent location. beautiful gardens and very clean.

30253603,Dan,March,2022,Location. location. location. and it doesn‚Äôt get better than right on the beach.  Very friendly hosts that were easy to reach and it‚Äôs located on one of the sandiest beaches in Rincon with a surf shop just up the hill to rent boards.  Appreciated the on site parking as well.  Comfortable interior but the main star of the room was definitely the beach. amazing location and a short drive into the main part of Rincon without all the nightlife noise.  Amazing stay. absolutely recommend.
30253603,Sarah,February,2022,Tamboo is great because it‚Äôs on the beach and in a great area. We went during a busy time so it was loud at night. you could hear cars with horns and loud music at 3am even over the AC and white noise machine I brought. The pool is incredibly small. but who cares when you‚Äôre staying on the beach? The staff is very nice and responsive.

30253603,Response from Tamboo,October,2021,Hello Gabriel. thank you for taking your time to write about your experience at Tamboo. We are a hotel endorsed by the PR Tourism Company and we have some of our rooms available for rent through the Airbnb Platform. Our parking was not broken but due to electric issues during your stay it was not closed so you would not have to manually open and close it every time you were to arrive/leave. thankfully it is now fixed and not an issue. We understand. as you explained through a phone call. that your concept of an airbnb is to have a property all for your own. Our listing has a very detailed explanation that there are some areas that will be shared if other rooms are occupied as some other Airbnb's have. Have an excellent day!Show more

39840559,Lorraine,April,2022,We enjoyed our stay. There was an effort to detail in the common space to make it inviting. The views were great & so was Sandy Beach that was right down the road. The hotel felt safe but beach basic. It was fine if you know what you‚Äôre getting. The room was very cold with the AC in so I was glad I packed a sweatshirt & pants based on previous reviews.
39840559,Danica,February,2022,Beautiful views and good location. The pool was unique and great for adults.
39840559,Adam,January,2022,Our stay at Serenity was one of the best AirBNB experiences I‚Äôve had up to this point. The crew is top notch. the room was extremely spacious. the view was incredible. the location fantastic. and I was really able to recharge my internal battery which is what I needed most from this trip. Thank you to Serenity. I highly recommend this AirBNB
39840559,Andrea,January,2022,third time staying at serenity and the same room. can‚Äôt get enough. clean. great location. calm and exactly the same as the photos üíö will continue to be my fav spot to stay at rinc√≥n

39840559,Priscila,June,2021,Great place
39840559,Kaitlin,June,2021,This place was lovely with gorgeous views. Bring sweat pants and long shirts though! The air conditioner is on 62 and you can't change it much as the host is trying to reduce the moisture in the room. Also. be sure to bring your own plateware and wine bottle opener. beer opener. etc. The room is not stocked with these amenities. The wading pool is nice üòå it isn't a hot tub with jets but it is relaxing :)
39840559,Natalia,January,2021,Amazing experience! Definitely coming back :) beautiful. comfy. homie space with great energy!!

39840559,Jamyl,December,2019,Our room had a nice ocean view from the balcony where there was a hammock as well and we really enjoyed it. The room was very cozy. smelled great and it could accommodate 4 persons easily (we were a couple). It has a refrigerator. coffeemaker and microwave which came in handy. The place has a great location very near all the nice attractions Rincon has to offer.

8266706,Kevin,October,2021,I don‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone. at least you take care of the observations that we mentioned above in the review. To many rules for a place that‚Äôs suppose to be for vacation. Place is isolated. Not clean at all ! This place is for someone who is looking to isolate themselves from the rest of the island. There‚Äôs no phone service. Pool can‚Äôt be used passed 9pm and there‚Äôs no drinking or smoking allowed on premises. Highly don‚Äôt recommend.
8266706,Alexandra E.,September,2021,This place is a must! Walking distance to the beach and a nice ocean view outdoor restaurant Mily recommended.  The area is very peaceful and the apartment was very sleek. beautiful. clean and has everything you will need. Will definitely come back.

8266706,Lizette,August,2021,Milly was a great host. she was there to greet us on our arrival. She gave us a tour of the place and gave us plenty of info about the area. The apartment itself was the perfect size for a couple. I loved that it was very modern.  clutter free and loved the art work which was painted/designed by a local artist. We didn‚Äôt use the pool. but it looked perfect for a dip.  The beach is also located steps away from The Red Palm. You can also take a 10 to 15 minute ride to other activities that I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll enjoy.
8266706,Joseph,August,2021,Highly recommended clean cute and overall amazing place!!
8266706,Emily,August,2021,We had a great experience here!  Beyond the fantastic location and lovely apartment. Mily and Astrid were very responsive and helpful throughout our stay.
8266706,Delila,August,2021,Mily was fantastic! She was very accommodating and very communicative. She recommended several places for us to go to. and they were all great! The apartment was perfect. had everything we needed for our stay. It was beautifully designed and a great location. only about a block away from the beach! It was walking distance to most places nearby. which made our stay even better since we hadn‚Äôt rented a car. We used a taxi service. and other places were within a 10-minute drive. We‚Äôll definitely stay at Red Palm again!
8266706,Molli,August,2021,Great place - beautiful location and perfect for our stay in rincon. Loved the pool. although the beach was definitely the main attraction. Would definitely come again.
8266706,Maria,July,2021,Miley‚Äôs place was fantastic. Perfect location in beautiful Rincon! Easy walking distance to the beach and a great beach bar. It was super clean and plenty spacious for the two of us. The outdoor space was amazing. Mily was a great host. too.
8266706,Brian,July,2021,The apartment a Red Palm is beautifully appointed and Very clean. It‚Äôs is less then 100 yards to the beach.

8266706,Nicole,June,2021,The property is quite lovely and well-maintained. There are about two or three units. The one I was in was small. spacious. modern. and comfortable. Walking distance to several restaurants and a nice. clean. walkable beach. Beautiful sunrise and sunset walking.Location is about 15-minute drive to downtown Rinc√≥n which has little shops. restaurants. pharmacy. gas stations. etc. Mily was there to greet me. give me a lay of the land. and allow me to ask questions. She was super helpful and attentive to other guests on the property as well.I appreciated a comfortable space to land my heart after the last year and a half of no travel due to the pandemic.
8266706,Gerardo,June,2021,Mily was Great. Once we arrived she gave us a tour and showed us the amenities her place offered. She also suggested places to eat and visit while we stayed. Throughout our stay she stood in contact with us asking how our stay was going as well as suggesting great restaurants to visit. One night we had a question about the pool hours and she was very prompt in answering us. She is strongly recommend.
8266706,Melissa,June,2021,Beautiful. clean. spacious. and right across Restaurant Tamboo to soak in the sunset on the beach while sipping coconut mojitos. The pool was awesome (especially because it rained a lot when we were in rinc√≥n- we had to postpone some beach times but the pool was a great escape too!)  10 min drive from downtown Rinc√≥n and The Red Palm even offers beach chairs. coolers. and beach towels you can take on your excursions! That was a great touch and came in very handy for all the beaches we went to.  Would definitely stay again

8266706,Jackie,February,2016,What an amazing stay at an amazing place.  The Red Palm is perfectly located just steps from the beautiful Sandy Beach as well as some great bars and restaurants.  Also an easy drive to the many surf spots in the area.The apartment itself was immaculate and very well equipped.  Perfect size for a couple with large bedroom. bathroom and ample living space.  Very modern and minimalist.  No clutter or unnecessary furniture.  Well appointed and tasteful.Mily was a fantastic host.  We arrived to a fridge stocked with welcome beers. milk. local coffee and fresh bread.  She gave us tons of great info on the area and free drink vouchers for some of the local bars. She was also adamant that we should just text if we needed anything at all.We didn't use the pool but it is lovely.  I'll also add that the shutters provide ample protection from the noise any late night revelers might be making after a long day of surfing. Will definitely return!!!Show more
8266706,Baron,February,2016,Amazing property. amazing location. amazing owners!  We had the best time staying at Red Palm!  Everything was perfect and the owners went above and beyond our expectations to show us around.  You will not be disappointed in staying at this property.

8266706,Lizanya,July,2021,We loved the place from the decor to the location. I would definitely come back. I fell in love with Rincon. Although the pool is shared. the times I used it there was no one. The only thing we didn't like was that the power went out and although there is a plant. the air was not cooling well but when we contacted Milly she brought us two fans so we didn't get hot. Communication with her was excellent.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
8266706,Karolina,November,2020,First intention we thought it was private until we arrived that we saw that they were multiple apartments and the pool was shared. we did not use it because there were more guests. other than that excellent place to just spend the night and go out during the day.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

8921767,Margaret,January,2022,Surf View Villa is a large property at the top of a residential street in Rincon. This property has many bedrooms and numerous places both indoors and outdoors to gather. The highlight for our family of six was time spent on the back porch. enjoying the view of the nearby trees and the ocean in the distance. Beautiful Sandy Beach is at the bottom of the hill. a 15 minute walk. The house is well equipped. and we especially enjoyed the ping pong table.
8921767,Franchie,August,2021,Great view of the ocean. specious home. During our stay the temperature during the night was very pleasant that some night we only used the fans.
8921767,Maggie,July,2021,Great space for families
8921767,Brianna,June,2021,A great spot!! So many rooms and space. The kitchen is well-equipped as described. and there is a ton of indoor and outdoor living space for a big group. We especially loved morning coffee on the deck and hammock. It‚Äôs a bit of a hill but definitely walkable down to Tamboo and surfers beach area! Property manager was super responsive and helpful. Great for families or large groups of friends. The ONLY reason I can‚Äôt give this place 5 stars is because the neighbors have roosters that will almost certainly wake you up at 4 am. especially in the downstairs bedrooms.
8921767,Alan,June,2021,Our stay was delightful! The place is big and comfortable. The deck in the back and the area downstairs are perfect for some fun & bonding. Ping Pong table was fun too. The host was very responsive and helpful whenever we experienced any issues. Great amenities. Not too far from coastal area and rincon pueblo. Would recommend!
8921767,Ann,June,2021,Our stay at Joseph‚Äôs home was wonderful.  We had plenty of room for 8 adults.  The view was spectacular and was close to several beaches and lots of local eateries.
8921767,Adrienne,May,2021,The house was wonderful! The outdoor area was a great gathering place for cooking. eating. relaxing. & having fun - no matter what the weather surprised us with. The ping pong table was so much fun. The owner &/or property manager answered questions quickly & were so helpful. We would definitely book again!
8921767,Kathryn,May,2021,The house is very spacious. comfortable and has a well-stocked kitchen.  It has enough room for everyone to gather together and plenty of space for everyone to get a little alone time as well.  We loved having  breakfast and dinner on the upper deck.  Beautiful view from there.   The neighbors were friendly and felt it is a safe neighborhood.  If I had any questions. David was super quick with a response.  The location is close to the beaches and a restaurants.   Awesome views from both decks!   Thank you Joseph and David for sharing your space :)
8921767,Alex,April,2021,Joseph‚Äôs house is great! More than enough space for our group of 9. All the amenities you could ask for. A (hilly) ~10 minute walk to multiple beaches and shops on the Rincon shore.
8921767,Response from Joseph,April,2021,Was a pleasure having you and your group Elda ! Would love to have you back.  I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed the amazing views!!

8921767,Broc,March,2021,Great airbnb! Definitely recommend
8921767,Rudy,January,2021,Great location. close to all of the local surf. Super fun ping pong table and common area downstairs. There was an ac issue night 1 and the property Mgr was ultra responsive and had it fixed by the next morning. If you're an early riser you are in luck as the local roosters will surely be a natural alarm clock. Overall. great place to stay-would definitely stay again.
8921767,Michael,January,2021,Amazing view to enjoy your morning coffee or a glass of wine :)
8921767,Eric,August,2020,awesome place to stay
8921767,Response from Joseph,August,2020,Thank you! I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed the Villa.
8921767,Mildred,July,2020,This is a great home for a large group. The rooms were very accommodating for our family. Plenty of room for entertainment. We enjoyed the ping pong table. & had a nice bbq with the grill provided. Good location. great views & close to beach. Only complaint I have are the doors.  They are very loud when opening & closing & makes it difficult to sleep while others are still awake. The door to the upstairs balcony in particular I think rubs against the floor & makes a very loud noise when opening & closing. Minor but very annoying. Other than that this is a fun home with a good host.
8921767,Response from Joseph,August,2020,Unfortunately Jessica did not treat my home well.  My Villa was left a mess with food on the floor in one of the bedrooms. a garbage disposal jammed with food. and one of the guests' in her group vandalized my landscaping with a machete that was found in the laundry room.  She refused to pay for the damages in full.  Then gave a bad review.  I should have been more careful in choosing this guest who had no prior reviews.Show more
8921767,Christian,July,2020,The house is perfect for a group stay. everything is easy and simple. Just a few minutes walk down to the beach and food. The view from the backyard and the sunsets there were magical. Ping pong table is great and having that bar down stairs truly made it fun. I look forward to staying again.
8921767,Brennan,March,2020,Joe's place is big. with amazing views and an ideal location.  Great for a large family or a big group of friends.
8921767,Sharon,March,2020,The Surf Villa was in a great location. It's an easy to drive to the local beaches. restaurants. bars. shopping. etc. The outdoor spaces (front and back patio) are relaxing and spacious. Communication from the hosts is friendly. helpful. and quick.
8921767,Jackie,February,2020,Beautiful place! The place was clean and the communication was great. We were very comfortable as a group and loved the location for access to surf breaks. town life. and amazing views.  We lived on the porch and were very happy to have a well stocked kitchen to cook for ourselves. Thank you for a lovely spot to sun and relax!
8921767,John Henry,February,2020,The surf view villa is fantastic for any large group coming to Rincon for leisure. surf. or both! The house is large enough for plenty of privacy from other group members but has great common areas such as the living room and especially the outside upper deck and lower porch ‚Äì the grill. outdoor kitchen. and ping pong table are huge bonuses. Would recommend this to surfers as well for its proximity to many breaks such as Maria's. Dome's. and Sandy Beach. Joseph and David are also extremely helpful and reply quickly.
8921767,Alex,February,2020,Joe‚Äôs place is great for a big group visit.  It‚Äôs close to restaurants (10 min walk down the hill). Sandy Beach and near PR413.  Kitchen is well equipped and the back patio is fantastic for stunning views.  I would stay again.  Joe is still working out some issues with the next door neighbor‚Äôs pets but I‚Äôm confidant these will be resolved soon.
8921767,Christin,January,2020,We were a group of 10. 30-somethings and we truly enjoyed staying at this house.  We made full use of the grill. well stocked kitchen. and 2 fridges - loved the ping pong table and even chilled out and watched Netflix on a few rainy afternoons.  The location of the home was ideal for a mixed group since there are many options for activities. food. and drink within easy walking distance.  Highlight was probably the back porch - the group spent about half of the trip eating. drinking. watching wildlife. and enjoying each other out there.  Highly recommended!
8921767,Lucia Anne,January,2020,Great space for a group. We enjoyed the view!  Lovely to eat on the deck all together.  And playing ping pong in the evening was a blast.

The kitchen is fully stocked and we wish we had more time to take advantage of the grill! My son keeps asking when we can go back to the ‚Äúping pong house‚Äù - the table is great.
8921767,Brendan,April,2019,Great location up the hill from everything in rincon. outdoor space provides a great place to start and end days. Ping pong table is icing on the cake. would come back and stay again

I've passed the issue with the living rooms being dirty to my property manager who assured me they would make sure all rooms are spotless going forward.   In response to you having to wait. I think what happened was your times changed a couple times.  Initially you were to arrive at 11am. then it was changed to 4pm. but ultimately you showed at 7:30pm.  The fortunate thing is my manager lives across the street so was able to get over there in a relatively short period of time.  Lastly. the microwave just needed a reset. and the fridge has since been serviced and is now working.  Thank you very much!  Show more

30229984,Vilmarie,June,2021,The employees at Tamboo were so friendly and accommodating! The restaurant was open the first night we got there which Was great because we were able to eat there after a long trip but the restaurant is not open every night so that‚Äôs something good to know. The beach in rinc√≥n is beautiful but not very kid friendly so that‚Äôs something also good to know for families with young kids. Also the wifi in the apt wasn‚Äôt working and when asked they told us it wasn‚Äôt working in the whole rinc√≥n town. And lastly the hotel was under construction for a pool and it happened to be right underneath our room so it was pretty loud. I wish that wasn‚Äôt happening during our stay. Other than that. the apt was clean. beds were comfortable and food very good at restaurant and I repeat the service and employees were amazing!!!!

30229984,Response from Tamboo,April,2021,Thank you for sharing your experience Leanne. We do not provide beach towels but we have them for sale at our Tambootique. We happily provide bath towels to our guests staying 3 nights or more.   We believe it is unfair to say our restaurant staff is rude. when our team got your  family a table even after our last seating time. without having a reservation beforehand on your first day of your stay. We understand if you did not felt comfortable at the restuarant after your husband's attitude towards our staff when we  informed how sorry we were we did not have any tables available. Our Tamboo Team loves providing all of our clients with the best experence in order to be able to greet them again someday. What we do not appreciate is rudeness and disrespectful guests to our staff members. Have an excellent day.Show more

30229984,Response from Tamboo,December,2020,We are a hotel that has been endorsed by the Puerto Rico Tourism Company for over 15 years. We pride ourselves in providing the best experience for all of our guests. That being said. our apartment was left in horrible conditions by Allyson‚Äôs party. They did not follow hotel policies and damaged several items beyond repair. The dishes were left unwashed and the drain was left completely clogged and full of food. a plumber had to be called in order to repair and unclog the sink. There were also broken glasses that had to be replaced and incredible amounts of trash around the apartment. Our mattress topper was also peed on and had to be thrown away and replaced. The top of a white desk was also scribbled on with a blue ink pen which we were not able to remove. When Natalia our receptionist contacted the group to inform them of all the damages and the charges. they proceeded to turn very hostile towards her and to threaten us with leaving a bad review. We have photo evidence of all the damages and are prepared to present it if the situation comes to that. If Allyson and her party would have followed the hotel policies and left the apartment with no damages then she would not have been billed the amount for the incidentals. unfortunately. that was not the case here. We stand by our team and will continue to provide the outstanding service that we are characterized by to those who choose to stay with us in our little piece of paradise by the beach.Show more
30229984,Vanessa,November,2020,Natalia did an incredible job guiding us to restaurants. surfing gear. snorkeling gear. etc. Everyone was extremely hospitable and kind. The apartment was gorgeous. the location & view were impeccable. and we loved the private parking. Thank you so much! We hope to return soon ‚ò∫Ô∏è
30229984,Maristela,October,2020,Great place. great location. Looking forward to future stays.
30229984,Gerardo,August,2020,Great location. literally on the beach. Great response if you have a problem and excellent amenities for a great price. Love to stay again with my friends!
30229984,Mint,March,2019,This is one of the most convenient stay I've ever had. The b each is just down the steps. and the bar/restaurant is right there. Short walks to nearby activities like yoga/ message/ surf rentals/ other beaches. Just note that the music from the bar could be loud on Friday and Saturday nights but if you like to party and dance by the ocean then it's perfect.

39811068,Stephanie,December,2022,This place was beautiful and very tranquil and exactly as described. The only complaint I have is the wifi wasn‚Äôt working and I had to get some work done on my laptop so that really screwed my work day.If you bring a pet. it‚Äôs not the most pet friendly area to walk a dog. It is fairly close to restaurants and attractions. so that was nice. but very hilly to get to at first.The host was very helpful with checking in and sent great restaurant recommendations.
39811068,Felix,December,2022,Reserved for a weekend and this place is just stunning perfect for reconnecting with your partner private and very romantic. there is so much to do restaurants.bakeries.bars and the beach are just minutes away. Had a great weekend this place just gives you the perfect vibe very relaxing!! Will be back for sure!!
39811068,Wesley,December,2022,Brought my Girlfriend for a getaway and to visit family. It was a great place and location. We loved the place. Close to many local restaurants and beautiful beaches. We would love to go back soon ! The host communicated greatly. told us about some awesome places. Thank you for having us!
39811068,Noemi,December,2022,Beautiful place very romantic üòç The people around the neighborhood are very friendly. You must visit Don Juan his an agricultor very knowledgeable and friendly. Must stay.
39811068,Andres,November,2022,good. this is our second stay
39811068,Nashalie,November,2022,This beautiful gem is nestled on a hill of Rincon with a spectacular view. Just a 10 minute drive to downtown and the beach. Is the perfect romantic getaway.The owner is also spectacularly friendly and attentive. Gave us a list of places to visit and was very accommodating. If you‚Äôre thinking about it. do it! You‚Äôll love the experience.
39811068,Gabriel,November,2022,Great place very attentive host
39811068,Andrea,October,2022,We communicated with the host and she did not answer until the very end
39811068,Ronier,October,2022,‚úÖ
39811068,Jose Antonio,October,2022,AMAZING !!Outstanding service and a fantastic place!
39811068,Sabrina,October,2022,The most beautiful and secluded property! Super close by the beach. restaurants. and supermarkets. Everything you need is less than a 10 min drive away. The property itself is stunning. The private pool and bathtub make for such a beautiful experience along with all the thoughtful touches from the hosts. We had run into a few plumbing issues but the host drove out as soon as possible and fixed it immediately. The host was super accommodating and responsive which made the experience all the better. If you stay here definitely stop by the Beach House for a beautiful sunset and great food. Will definitely be coming back!!
39811068,Giselle,September,2022,Going into this review I would like to at least give them the fact that our stay was during the aftermath of a hurricane. That being said. my partner and I reached out to them after our original air bnb had given us an HONEST response about losing their power and water and we were told that our stay here would have water and electricity. We checked in late. and as we arrived two other guests were driving out saying the building had no power or water all day and they would rather stay somewhere else. It was already too late for us to plan another stay and we had just driven 3 hours to them from san juan to be able to have some utilities for the night. We had to spend the night without showering any fans or lighting or being able to flush the toilet. Our phones had also died and we had no way to reach out to them in the morning. which wouldn‚Äôt have made much of a difference because the response time was horrible anyway. After having to navigate through a town we didnt know without our phones in order to find a way to charge our phones we finally managed to negotiate a way to be refunded (they were acting like the power had just went out when we arrived that night but the guests leaving said it was out all day) we were harassed by the women cleaning the room behind us who thought we didnt understand spanish while they bad mouthed us and talked about how we shouldnt have booked a place there knowing they didnt have power.Show more
39811068,Shir,August,2022,Me and my best friend came for a quick 4 days getaway and honestly I can say It  was money well spent. We had a great time and the rooms are beautiful. When we had a little plumbing issue they upgraded our room and made sure we felt so comfortable and honestly the place is gorgeous. Definitely coming back again.
39811068,Alyssa,August,2022,Such a nice place with a beautiful view. She was very helpful with everything
39811068,Keith,August,2022,This place is perfect for a romantic getaway and the host help you with anything you may need during your stay. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back!
39811068,Christine,August,2022,Getaway to a secret corner of Rincon... you won't regret the energy and relaxation built into the intimate space.
39811068,Janise,June,2022,not so good
39811068,Richard,June,2022,Great communication with the host and a nice place to disconnect from the outside world!
39811068,Justin,June,2022,Great place in Rincon!
39811068,Joseph,June,2022,This is a great stay for the value! The room is just as nice as it looks. very cool and comfortable. The water pressure was not great in the shower. but the soaking tub has a spout high enough to wash hair if you sit in it. so honestly wasn‚Äôt even a problem. The location is fantastic. Definitely would recommend having a vehicle with plenty of drive power as the roads in Rincon are very steep. but here you will be 5-15 minutes away from all of the best spots in town. Such a great stay!! Would return.
39811068,Emmanuel,June,2022,Great place to unwind! Would recommend!
39811068,Javier,June,2022,Perfect for a honey moon! So romantic
39811068,Frankie,May,2022,The pictures are beautiful but doesn‚Äôt do it justice. Absolutely amazing Airbnb
39811068,Johannes,May,2022,Great place to relax and unwind. Pool was excellent temperature upon arrival. Only thing was that the water pressure was very low and not enough hot (or even warm) water to shower and the bed was not very comfortable. but everything else was amazing.
39811068,Lyzmar,May,2022,She was an outstanding host ‚ú®
39811068,Yadgel,May,2022,Great place!!
39811068,Edmundo,May,2022,Super clean and comfortable space with an excellent communication with the host.
39811068,Kyle,April,2022,Very beautiful view from the apartment. I had a great time with my girlfriend and really just a wonderful place to stay. It‚Äôs a little hard to find at first but once your settled in it‚Äôs cozy and romantic.
39811068,Tanisha,April,2022,Had some issues with water pressure and hot water on arrival - host was very responsive and fixed everything right away.The views and plunge pool were amazing! The coffee machine is a proper espresso machine. which was great once we figured it out with a helpful video from the host. The kitchen isn‚Äôt really useful (one pot. one pan and a spatula). so I would not suggest staying here if you intend to cook at all.Location is central to anything you would want to do in Rinc√≥n.
39811068,Desiree,April,2022,1. The water pressure was in some moments a challenge. 2. Sometimes in the sink the water didn‚Äôt work. Or in the kitchen. Had to basically open them to see which one was working. 3. Unstable water temperature. Sometimes it was really hot in one area I had to use the sink in the kitchen for normal temperature water. 4. The mosquitoes were a nightmare. Even while using off day and night my legs are with over 20+ mosquitoes bites. 5.  There‚Äôs gaps in the door and mosquitoes and other insects can enter. We killed a lot of mosquitoes in addition to spiders. I think the room needs an update. Maybe new doors to avoid little insects inside the room. 6. They can improve the toiletries. Cero conditioners only one bar of soap and two shampoos. For girls with long as hair that won‚Äôt do. 7. Maybe is time for changing the outside curtains some looked like the color faded. 8. To get there was something. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it was close to Rincon Plaza. If you‚Äôre not confortable driving in small streets it‚Äôll put you to the test to get to the Airbnb. 9. The space was good. Good mini refrigerator. Love the privacy of the room. Room doesn‚Äôt have a closet. Only 2 hangers.Show more
39811068,Sara,April,2022,This was a lovely experience. Halfway between luxury and glamping. even during an island-wide blackout the owners had a generator for our comfort. Water takes a second to flow and hot water takes some time warm up. but they are transparent about that in the description too. Rincon is beautiful and the host provided a bunch of restaurant recommendations which we took and loved! They were extremely communicative and attentive without encroaching on our privacy. Definitely bring your favorite mosquito spray‚Äîthey provide you with some for your skin and the room too. but you‚Äôre in a beautiful garden oasis on a tropical island so come prepared. (Ps. Must be able to climb steps to access.) Thank you again!!
39811068,Catherine,April,2022,Super relaxing. beautiful space.
39811068,Jade,March,2022,Beautiful room and we felt extremely safe.
39811068,Cheri,March,2022,Great room. but lots of mosquitoes
39811068,Charles,March,2022,phenomenal location!!!
39811068,Hannah,March,2022,We loved staying here! It was absolutely gorgeous. We enjoyed the sounds of nature around us. it was very peaceful. The only advice I have is to close the bedroom door right away when coming in/out from the pool area to make sure mosquitoes don‚Äôt come in. Overall highly recommend !!
39811068,Leonardo J.,March,2022,Perfect!!
39811068,Vanessa,March,2022,Beautiful suite and great stay! Private dipping pool was such a plus.
39811068,Breanna,March,2022,This room was beautiful- just as pictured with breathtaking views.  Great location. close to beaches and downtown Rincon. I did feel this room was overpriced. We had a few issues with the water; mostly water pressure and temperature- as was mentioned in previous reviews. We did loose water for sometime but it eventually came back on. There are gaps in the doorway that let in mosquitoes and flies. The host does provide bug spray and bug killer. but that was not ideal.
39811068,Natasha,March,2022,This space is a really special experience. We were happy to have snagged a few nights here while in Rincon. The plunge pool was a little cold. but in the summer months would be perfection. Beautifully decorated and cozy. The only downsides were the water pressure in the shower and tub were really low and parking is a bit precarious- but a very experienced driver should have no problem and luckily I had one with me. 100% recommend!
39811068,Paola,February,2022,This place is beyond beautiful and intimate! Great for a couple get away and so central to other great places in Rincon! The water pressure is very low in the shower sometimes but apart from this our whole stay was amazing.
39811068,Victoria,February,2022,One of the cutest AirBnb‚Äôs I have stayed at! We wished we‚Äôd planned to stay here our whole trip- the room was so cute . location was close to local food and the beaches. and the communication from the host was great. Water pressure is low.  but that didn‚Äôt bother us much- we just used the sprayer in the bath tub. And. if you‚Äôre not an early riser. just know there are roosters nearby who are (ha). The host does provide a sound machine though. My husband and I give our stay a 10/10 and would love to stay again on our next trip to PR
39811068,Sergio,February,2022,Great get away
39811068,Amanda,February,2022,The location was great- super close to beaches and restaurants. The bed was comfy. the AC and Internet worked well. However. there is no hot water (anywhere. including the ‚Äúhot tub‚Äù) and the shower water pressure only lasts about 5 mins. The ceiling leaked in multiple places when it rained- I told the host but they didn‚Äôt seem concerned so I doubt it will be fixed. Roosters are loud all day and night.
39811068,Lauren,February,2022,It was a lovely Airbnb. perfect location & aesthetic for what we were looking for. Had a great and peaceful time. host provided lots of info & restaurant suggestions. Loved.
39811068,Kala,January,2022,Zaza's place is pretty nice. It was very accurate to the photos. and the bed was very comfy. I was disappointed to find there was very low (almost no) water pressure so when showering I couldn't even properly remove the sand. and filling the tub would have taken forever. I booked this place excited to use the tub. but the night I wanted to take a bath there was no hot water at all. So not that relaxing. good thing it was hot so the cold showers felt nice. although my girlfriend didn't enjoy it so much. On the positive. Zaza did provide a lot of recommendations for places to eat. The place is a short drive to restaurants and beaches. but you definitely have to have a car to get here.
39811068,Hollie,January,2022,PERFECT for pampering yourself! We stayed as part of our honeymoon and couldn‚Äôt be happier with the place. The decor made it feel very special and luxurious. and the views were amazing. We spent hours in the plunge pool every day - it was the perfect temperature day and night. A/C worked great and bed was comfortable. Zaza was a great host: responsive and clear. and gave plenty of food recommendations. Things to be prepared for: steep/windy roads. roosters in the morning/evening. coquis at night. mosquitos here and there. low water pressure (including toilet).
39811068,Carlos,January,2022,This is a great place to share with your couple. Rincon is an awesome place but you dont need to go out of this special and cozy studio. Entire day in the pool. watch the sunset and then come inside the room and a warm tub waiting for you. TV with Hulu if you want to watch some TV. Lots of alternatives to eat or you can have food delivered to your door. Awesome! We want to come back!
39811068,Lorena,January,2022,Great location! Very cozy
39811068,Lingge,January,2022,The tub is not really functional because water pressure is low so that it‚Äôd take forever‚Ä¶ and the location is a bit out of the way.
39811068,Natalie Ann,December,2021,This is a spectacular place. The private pool it is to die for. You have a spectacular view from the tub and from the shower. Ypu can relax and breath peace. The only two things is that finding hot water it‚Äôs a challenge on the shower and the little stove doesn‚Äôt work. So heads up on that. Other than that it is a great space for couples. Oh and you have to take a few stairs so have that in mind.
39811068,Johamir,December,2021,You‚Äôll have the time of your life!
39811068,Howard,December,2021,Amazing place. it is a hidden gem
39811068,Jaydeep,December,2021,My fianc√©e and I had a great time staying at this Airbnb. Communication was quick and the host also provided us suggestions for local food/drinks which was helpful. Definitely recommend renting a car/having a car to go as it will be easier. Has internet and TV as well. There are mosquitoes but we were provided with bug repellent. Hot tub water pressure is not the best but shower worked great. Overall vibes for the Airbnb were great!
39811068,Mariangely,December,2021,Nice d√©cor. It wasn‚Äôt what I expected for the price. It wasn‚Äôt clean. It has cockroaches in the kitchenette. Spider webs with spiders on it. Water pressure from the shower doesn‚Äôt exist neither the hot water. Last night there was a power outrage and we had to sleep without a fan or air conditioner because the power generator doesn‚Äôt start automatically.
39811068,Carlos,November,2021,This place is located in a spectacularly beautiful place.  It has tremendous views of nature and part of the Rincon sea.  It is a tremendous option to go with your spouse and have some relaxation time.  The owner is very attentive and communicative.  100% recommended.
39811068,Veronica,November,2021,We stayed for our minimoon amd had a blast! The suite was beautiful and very romantic. it was excatly what we wanted. The location is great. we were  near restaurants. grocery stores. and beaches. Zaza had constant communication with us and made our stay easy. We definitely recommend staying here! The view. the feel. the decor. everything was beautiful!
39811068,Edgar,October,2021,I recommend this place! Beautiful place!
39811068,Janice,October,2021,This Airbnb was an stunning and unique experience. One of a kind in Puerto Rico. It truly made my trip amazing.
39811068,Zailiz,September,2021,The place looked beautiful. a little overpriced for what it matters but beautiful. It was clean and it smelled great. The only problem we had was the air conditioner. it didn't work properly and the last night we had to sleep with the ceiling fan. When we opened it to push the button manually as instructed a bunch of mosquitos came out. Overall it was great just expected a bit more.
39811068,Edgar,September,2021,Great location. amazing air bnb
39811068,Karla J,September,2021,amazing place. so clean. beautiful and relaxing..would recommend

39811068,Janelisse,June,2021,Lovely place to stay!
39811068,Ryan,June,2021,Absolutely beautiful! The location is great and she was extremely helpful. We want to stay in a different room next time for bigger pool. Would definitely recommend for a nights stay!
39811068,Anita,May,2021,This was a really nice getaway. The place was clean and very beautiful. The only downside is mosquitos and bugs but that should be expected for a place like this lol. I HIGHLY recommend Renting a car if you‚Äôre staying here. Uber‚Äôs don‚Äôt work there and taxis have to be booked ahead of time. I really enjoyed my stay and might go back for a different suite. Overall a great and lovely place
39811068,Sandra,May,2021,You‚Äôll leave this place with  a desire to bring back home some ideas from this suite.
39811068,Aurea,May,2021,Lovely place to retreat. Recommend!
39811068,Joel,May,2021,Very nice view
39811068,Gabi,May,2021,The house was beautifully decorated and very cozy. The pool was very nice and the hot tub too. The host was available at all times and check in went very smoothly. The location is not the greatest but it's not bad if you have a car. This airbnb is also very adequately equipped with anything you might need. However. I will say that this house was way too expensive considering we did experience several inconveniences. For example. the shower had no pressure and there was no hot water. The bed was very uncomfortable too. I wasn't too thrilled about the area where the house is located either. Overall. the house is very pretty and we enjoyed our stay but you may want to consider these things before booking such an expensive house.
39811068,Daniel,April,2021,Great Experience
39811068,Nicole,April,2021,Lovely cozy and tropical place. ü§ç Best suite and most complete in my opinion. ü§ç
39811068,Fernando J.,April,2021,Great place. peacefull and calm. Very nice.
39811068,Nelia,April,2021,Amazing. romantic and private apartment!
39811068,Carmarie,April,2021,Great place for a romantic getaway or a solo trip. It‚Äôs pet friendly. so you can tag along with your furry friend. The private pool was amazing. it provides a relaxing atmosphere. I highly recommend this place!
39811068,Viviana,April,2021,Casa Florencia is an amazing place where you can have a relaxing experience. The room was very clean and neat. It is decorated with an exquisite taste. Regarding the amenities. it has everything you need to spend a few days. like a stove. fridge. coffee maker and a little sink. The bath tub is amazing. and the view provides a space for you to relax and enjoy the tranquility of Rinc√≥n. Last but not least. the pool. It has the perfect size for a couple to chill and enjoy.Two things that you should know is that the toilet sometimes keeps running. but the host already knows and is willing to fix it and you just always keep the door close because of the mosquitoes.I recommend Casa Florencia to all the couples that want to spend a nice quiet and relaxing weekend. You will definitely not regret staying in Casa Florencia.Show more
39811068,Bernadette,April,2021,We enjoyed our little staycation.  The room details were nice and the view from the bathtub is beautiful.  The bed was comfortable and we enjoyed the outdoor area.  It was small but it was good enough for the two of us.  I appreciate the curtains for privacy from the neighbors.  Some things that I would share with others is the noise of roosters.  We live in Puerto Rico and are used to this but for people who aren‚Äôt be aware that you will be woken up by the sounds so maybe a white noise while you sleep could drown it out.  Also while we were there they were power washing so I‚Äôm sure it was a lot louder than normal.  Other than the noise it was a nice stay. Close to restaurants.
39811068,Maryedith,March,2021,Exactly like the pictures! Such a beautiful and quiet place with gorgeous views from many different parts of the suite. Not sure if the jacuzzi had a heater but the water was lukewarm and felt incredible! Everything was spotless and super nice down to the details! 10/10 recommend!
39811068,LeAnn,March,2021,We enjoyed our stay here. Everything was as pictured. The house is a little hard to find. Water pressure is low as other reviews have stated but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs something that can be fixed. This is the best Airbnb we‚Äôve ever stayed in despite those 2 minor issues. I loved the whole ambiance & would definitely return. Perfect for a couple getaway.
39811068,Sonaily,March,2021,Amazing!!!

39811068,Manuel,December,2020,Loved our stay! Very private apartment with excellent views. Great place for couples to relax. The personal dipping pool is awesome. specially now during the pandemic and all the executive order restrictions. Kitchen is on the smaller side so if not planning on eating out and cooking take this into consideration. Would definitely recommend (already have). Book ahead as it is usually booked a few months in advance. no surprise why.

39811068,Elvin,October,2020,Excellent place to stay with a glorious view of the sunset from the room and the pool. It was clean and it has great communication with the host and cleaning staff in case you need something from them. The place is very quiet and calm. and although COVID-19 has affected the restaurants. there are good places around to eat and close from the area. Highly recommended to everyone!

39811068,Christina,September,2020,Overall. the suite is beautiful and just as pictured. The water pressure in the shower and in the tub are both terrible. You have to turn the knob in the shower a certain way in order for the water to come out of the entire shower head and we left the water in the tub running for about an hour and it had only filled up 1/4 of the way. Aside from this. we did not have any major issues and the suite was absolutely gorgeous and relaxing. I would recommend bringing a lighter. Since the villa is up in the mountains. there are a lot of mosquitos and they provided a candle repellent. but we had nothing to light it with.
39811068,Sandra,September,2020,Worth It!
39811068,Edgar,August,2020,Much better than I expect
39811068,Dennise,August,2020,You will not regret choosing the best place for your vacation

39811068,Noedisellys,August,2020,We enjoyed our stay at Casa Florencia! It was a bit hard to find the location but the view was all worth it. It‚Äôs private pool. tub and shower were also fat-friendly! We loved everything. ‚ù§Ô∏è
39811068,Adfred,August,2020,Excellent property for an escape to Rincon. Relaxing getaway. Recommended. Will be back!
39811068,Carlos,July,2020,Make sure you have good communication with your host.
39811068,Ivan,July,2020,Amazing place!! It‚Äôs really a dream. the pool. the bedroom. bathroom. everything. Highly recommended.Perfect place to unwind and recharge
39811068,Irmarie,July,2020,Beautiful place with a great view. We had a great time. Although we had a problem with a leakage in the bathroom. the owner responded very quickly and fixed it.
39811068,Jackeline,July,2020,Absolutely loved this place. Great anniversary getaway. will definitely recommended it and will be back soon.
39811068,Keysha,July,2020,Bring coffee and food and you won‚Äôt have to leave the house for anything. Is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è
39811068,Jannilie,June,2020,The pool area and tub were to die for! Very stylish place and mostly private. Only 2 problems: We could hear the footsteps and noise from the neighbors upstairs. and the water pressure/heat was too low. But the place has a wonderful view and we enjoyed every minute of it!
39811068,Roselly,June,2020,Excellent place for a perfect getaway.
39811068,Melissa,June,2020,Nice little place. Feels like an hotel room. There‚Äôs very limited options for food around because of the current covid situation so I recommend to bring some food. Would have be nice if the place had some food recommendations for deliveries. It was good overall.
39811068,Laura,June,2020,Great place to visit! It‚Äôs a must. Sparkly clean. Awesome decor and view
39811068,Natalia,June,2020,Beautiful place. perfect for a couple getaway!

39811068,Bea,May,2020,Everything was great. the place is quiet and relaxing. Host was quick to respond and help with everything we needed  as soon as asked. Definitely would stay again.
39811068,Fernando,May,2020,Perfect getaway
39811068,Khristian,May,2020,Great place to stay with everything as seen in pictures! Host responded very quick and supportive when needed. and provided excellent amenities. Place was very clean. had everything needed for an outstanding day at the private pool while in quarantine and located in a peaceful quiet neighborhood with an awesome view. perfect for relaxing. The place was very easy to get to. room was very cozy. and had everything for a pleasant recovery after a long day around. Very close to restaurants. food trucks. grocery stores. beaches. rentals. and a lot of what the Rincon has to offer. Nothing to complaint. 100% recommended! Will definitely stay here again! Thanks for everything!
39811068,Valerie,May,2020,Everything was the same as presented in the photos. The atmosphere is romantic and cozy. A good option to get out of the routine.
39811068,Jaby,May,2020,It‚Äôs fantastic
39811068,Jean,April,2020,Amazing place. better than I expected. everything was perfect. And they had COFFEE ‚ù§Ô∏è
39811068,Lia Ivelisse,April,2020,I absolutely loved this place. I felt in love with the space. Waiting with anxiety to be back to this suite.
39811068,Lydia,April,2020,The space is beautiful! Pictures are accurate. When we arrived. we were under the impression that we had room 10 reserved. had we not contacted the host. we would‚Äôve not known that our reservation had been changed to Room 9. Otherwise. the host was very attentive and answered any questions we had via phone. As mentioned. the room is gorgeous. the view is quite breathtaking. However. we weren‚Äôt able to enjoy the bathtub because there was no water pressure. The water pressure became a problem in the shower as well. It takes about 10-20 minutes to get warm to hot and very little comes out...so keep that in mind! There is no microwave and the stove only has one burner available for cooking at a time. though very modern. Overall. it was nice to have a private pool available to us at anytime!
39811068,Irving,April,2020,Is a place to disconnect from the world and feel the silence.  You can enjoy the sunset from the hot tub or the pool.  It has a lovely espresso machine.  100% recommended.
39811068,Alexandra,March,2020,Such a beautiful and peaceful place. ¬°Amazing experience!
39811068,Sol,March,2020,One of the most beautiful and stylish places I have stayed at. Full luxury and comfort. Loved it!
39811068,Roberto,March,2020,Great romantic place to stay with your love one
39811068,Taoufik,March,2020,This place is incredible. it‚Äôs located in the mountains of Rincon. a small city in the north east of Puerto Rico. The landscapes from the room. the cuteness of the room. and the coziness of the small balcony with a plunge pool make this place a heaven. The host was amazing. he was available when we needed something. gave us tips about local restaurants. Trust me. you guys should try it. we going back sooon.
39811068,Camila,March,2020,Such a beautiful place to stay! The host was very attentive and helpful.
39811068,Chad,February,2020,An amazing. beautiful place and a great location
39811068,Brian,February,2020,You will remember it!  A suite like no other.
39811068,Mari,February,2020,Perfect getaway.
39811068,Ben,February,2020,The place is exactly as shown in photos. As another review stated. the pool in the apartment is not a hot tub.  but it‚Äôs still awesome to have it there. The room/property has an amazing view of the hills with the ocean in the distance. The room has a minifridge and an easy to use espresso machine with finely ground espresso available. The water takes ~10 minutes to heat up and ~20 minutes to get really hot. We had no problem showering with hot water after that but the water pressure wasn‚Äôt great. We were unable to fill the bathtub with hot water. Would stay again. We‚Äôve already recommended it to friends!
39811068,Amy,February,2020,After following casa florencia on instagram for months and a night opening during our stay in PR. I decided to book to check out what I kept seeing.  Our stay was amazing and having both the private plunge pool and the shared pool to use. we really enjoyed our stay at casa florencia.  It was easy to find. checkin/checkout was simple.  Loved the space and everything was well thought out and clean.  Loved having our own espresso maker and even though it's remote on a quiet road. there are some nice places to eat within a couple minutes of driving.  Would recommend and would love to stay again but will want to test out the other suites available like #3 or #10.
39811068,Nikole,January,2020,The spot is clean and beautiful. The view is incredible; a little far from locations like the plaza and beach. About 7-10min from most. It states it has a Hot Tub but it doesn't. It's a plunge pool that is cold because the sun doesn't hit it and a tub that takes a long time to fill and there's not enough hot water to make it warm. It's misleading and honestly the only reason I paid more that $100 for a night in a location far from the Plaza or beach. It was very disappointing. It's a 5 star place if the details were honest but it promised things that don't exist so made it too expensive for the reality that it is.
39811068,Emir,December,2022,Everything was spectacular.  Communication with hosts was excellent. And everything is very beautiful.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
39811068,Alexandra,December,2022,My experience was terrible. don't be fooled by the photos... when you get there it's totally different. I found cockroaches. the shower did not work and the place was dirty. The glass where the tub is. which is supposed to have a spectacular view. what is there is full of limes and many sticks. which you can't literally see anything... Worst of all. I told them and they didn't resolve it for us and they didn't want to give us the money back either. So much so that I couldn't stay the two nights I booked because of the conditions of the placeTranslated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

39811068,Melisa,February,2021,*Please show respect by doing the 6ft of physical distance in the BEACH* it‚Äôs for your safety too.It's just what I expected and more! You arrive in the afternoon and the plunch pool is warm by the sun. From there you see the beautiful sunset. The next day we got in the car to spend a day at the beach. 2 minutes away is Domes beach for surfing and cycling. 8 min Steps Beach for snorkeling. 10 minutes from the spa and more bathing beach downstairs. ((Please maintain 6 foot physical distance. do not be the tourist that makes locals uncomfortable sitting 3 feet from them on the beach. This is tolerable and a total disrespect. Covid19 has not disappeared.)) In the evening we had a romantic dinner at one of our favorite restaurants that cost Rincon and saw the sunset from the table. The next day checkout time! More beach! Don't forget. the must stop at Friends Caf√©- best coffee and frozen drinks.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

33310805,A.H.,June,2022,This place is perfect for a whole week. spending time with the family that likes to explore the area. It has all the necessities. The host would continuously stay in communication to meets all you needs. The BBQ area is good. I sat there to see the sunrising while doing homework. Excellent. The view to beach was not clear since there‚Äôs too much vegetation around. Also there‚Äôs no beach view from all living quarters.

33310805,Allen,August,2021,Beautiful place with all the amenities necessary for your pleasent vacation. I recommend this place 100%. Near to any Rincon places. Thanks.
33310805,Taylor,August,2021,Very beautiful and great location!! This place was even more beautiful then the pictures and the hosts were very friendly and welcoming!! I would say we ran into a couple of small issues that just seemed like bad timing and not the fault of the owners but thought I should mention. Unfortunately while we were there we had some trouble getting hot or even warm water in the shower. The hosts were aware and had mentioned the generator/water heater appeared to be having some issues and they were working on getting it fixed ASAP but we had this reoccurring issue for the multiple days we stayed there. At times the water pressure also had issues and would drop very low mid shower. and by low I mean not showerable. the water would just barely be dripping out of the showerhead. Another thing to note is we did read on the description of the place that there was a washer and dryer available to use and we had planned on using it for our lengthy stay in Puerto Rico as we were out there for a while transferring between multiple Airbnb‚Äôs and wanted to pack lightly. However we were also told the washer and dryer were not available for use while we were there as it too had broken down and they were trying to get it fixed...needless to say we had to spend more money buying some extra clothes and beach towels that we did not plan on. (If you will be going to the beach they do not provide beach towels so make sure to bring your own) Again. it just seemed like unfortunate timing for our stay that this had happened but worth mentioning. The only other issue we experienced was the a/c. The a/c worked amazing in the bedroom but did not seem to cool down the living room area. kitchen. or bathroom at all. If you were here for an adventurous. out in the town stay and just needed a place to sleep this might not be very bothersome. However if you plan on relaxing in the villa. note it does get very humid outside of the bedroom. I‚Äôm not sure if the a/c just wasn‚Äôt strong enough to transfer to the other rooms or if they needed a separate one for the living room area but we even left the bedroom door wide open hoping it would cool down the rest of the villa but it did not. The bedroom did cool down very very well though! Other then these small mishaps I would definitely give this place another shot and would still recommend giving it a try. The hosts were always close by and very kind to us throughout the stay. The place was very well kept and very clean! The villa is very beautiful with upgrades and the view is absolutely gorgeous to wake up to!Show more
33310805,Zabrina,July,2021,This place is awesome !! If you enjoy surfing and water sports this is the place to be. Lots of beach‚Äôs and restaurants/ bars just a few minutes away.

Beautifully decorated and well maintained.We‚Äôve stayed in Rincon many time throughout the years but from now on Lions Gate will be our place to go!

33310805,Aly,February,2021,Very cute bungalow‚Äôs and great communication on entry.
33310805,Jenny,January,2021,The only bummer about this place is that there's no comfy place to hang out. You drive into this beautiful property but have no place to sit and enjoy it!  No outdoor space/chairs to have AM coffee. enjoy the sounds of nature. etc. (worth mentioning that units 3 & 4 have chairs outside their front doors and unit 3 has a view from that space outside). Even inside. no comfy spot - small weird sofa. bed is OK at best. Also. no beach towels nor beach chairs provided which is 100% commonplace around Rincon.  Now on to the good - the place is super clean and has everything you need. It's clearly been re-done recently and feels new. Great shower with good water pressure (can be hard to come by in Rincon). Family that lives on the grounds is very sweet. Kitchen is nice. Coquis at night are magical with all the beautiful trees on the property. The host. John. is quick to respond and helpful.
33310805,Gladys,January,2021,If you are a couple looking for a modern. comfortable. affordable place in Rincon. look no further than Lions Gate Villas.  The villas are spacious. bathrooms have a spa-like feel to them. and the bedrooms are very comfortable!  The villas are located in a lovely section in Rincon and very close to the surfing beaches.  The owner was able to accommodate my very late booking request and it was greatly appreciated.  The owners answered all my questions quickly and even provided information on nearby restaurants and attractions.  The whole experience was pleasant. and look forward to returning this year!

555647587961186381,Response from Jennifer,May,2022,Roxanne. thanks for staying with us and we are sorry for the last minute issues you had on the last day of your stay. The a/c unit has been replaced and water shower too. We did responded immediately but it was late Saturday when you informed it after being over 24 hours at the property. Also. the airbnb site does not let me accept the refund which we have no problem providing as unforseen circumstances can always happen.Show more
555647587961186381,Philip,April,2022,Jennifer is super nice. The apartment is located on the ground floor with patio toward the beach.

555647587961186381,Trey,February,2022,This location is amazing! Right across the street is Balneario Rincon with a gorgeous view to sunset over the beach and marina just adjacent. We got super lucky this year and saw humpback whales migrating for the first time in several late winter/early spring trips to Rincon. (Feb 19-26 this year)Awesome bakery a few blocks the other direction with downtown Rincon. Thursday night art walk. and all the bars/restaurants around the plaza just an easy walk away. Hot water and showers were excellent. and the full kitchen (including oven. not just range) is well stocked with cookware and flatware. Host was responsive and helpful. Will definitely consider staying here on future trips!Did we mention it has a nice pool?

50086197,Michelle,December,2022,I loved the container . Everything inside was beautiful and clean. The pool was excellent but a coldüòÇ . The only thing i don‚Äôt like to much is the location. The Container is so beautiful but the location the houses around doesn‚Äôt look great for that beautiful place .
50086197,Elizabeth,December,2022,Looks exactly like it does in the pictures. Host was friendly and helpful. Beautiful area. peaceful. Would definitely recommend.
50086197,Leisla,December,2022,Great location! Nice place to have a relax weekend.
50086197,Felix,November,2022,Airbnb is close to center town/restaurant/bars.
50086197,Y,November,2022,The best was the private pool!If they had the kitchen outside the space in the container would be bearable. Too small even for 2 people. Also. host should mark off and not rent dates when they have property maintenance.
50086197,Laury,October,2022,It's a nice place. the pool it's great and the location it's perfect. The parking it's an issue. is in the grass and when it rains it's very messy. and inside there are a lot of different rugs so you have to take off your shoes. The bathroom is very small. but it's a tiny container so we expected that. but it's not clean as it should be. it has even dust. The kitchen stuff was very dirty. they need to clean that. we didn't even dare to use anything. It has potential to be better. they have a nice concept. but need to be more consistent with the cleanliness.
50086197,Ambar,October,2022,Such a wonderful little getaway!
50086197,Chris,October,2022,The location was perfect. location was close to restaurants..
50086197,Juan,September,2022,Place was nice!! It is small but perfect for a nice time with a loved one. Pool makes it perfect. also the bathroom is super nice. Its all neat. Thanks Nelson!
50086197,,MayraAugust,2022,Small and cozy. it was perfect for our two night stay. The communication with the host was great. he took care of all our needs :)
50086197,Jessica,August,2022,It is the prefect spot for a couples getaway weekend. Beautiful. cozy and clean. The pool has a roof so you will not get rain or too much sun. The lot is not completely private. It is next to the owner‚Äôs house and there was an RV on the back.
50086197,Krystal,August,2022,Place is pretty cute and pool is plenty private for you & your partner to spent some much needed quality time. The cleaning staff should be more attentive about the little details about the property. Freezer had frozen meat blood in the ice. Both shower head and bathroom sink had white water stains. Some cups were dirty when we went to get them from the cabinet. The bed sheets were broken in one of its corners. It had over three (3) loose floor boards and some. back doors to the pool liquids in when it rains. And some walls need a touch up. Overall the place is pretty good for a weekend stay. I dont recommend more than that. PS. in the pictures you cant see it but there's another airbnb behind this property and the owners house right next to it. So the property in it's self is not all that private besides the pool area.
50086197,Jamie,July,2022,This is a great spot to disconnect and unwind. The space is perfect for a weekend getaway. close to so many restaurants and the beach is close by as well. I would recommend this spot to anyone.
50086197,Yariana,June,2022,Great
50086197,Hugo,June,2022,It was a pretty nice stay but I believe there were some things that could have been better.
50086197,Nicole,June,2022,Everything is amazing. the location. pool. pricacy and also communication which is a 10/10. Overall it is an amazing experience and I would 100% recommend it.
50086197,Erin,May,2022,This place was as beautiful as the pictures and feels very private and secluded despite that it shares the property with another rental and a house.Would definitely recommend!
50086197,Madison,May,2022,I did really like the communication I had with the hosts. However the cleanliness of the space wasn‚Äôt great . One of the floor boards was coming up and the shower seemed  to be falling apart. I‚Äôm just glad my husband and I had another place that we are staying Puerto Rico I couldn‚Äôt have lasted my full trip there.
50086197,Sarah,May,2022,Cute container house.
50086197,Elwin,May,2022,Cozy place
50086197,Jose Angel,April,2022,This place is pretty and comfortable all de basics to spend a day or two.  bad for us . we have to spend the night without power electricity and water service do to a black out in the area . we contacte the Host about 10pm to see if they can come out with any solutions or suggestion. but they only wrote to us that the only thing I can do was wait. So we waited until 7am and yup no water and no electricity. We know that this isn‚Äôt a priority on owners to invest in power generators or water reserves but knowing that this is a common problem in Puerto Rico maybe a small water reserve in case of a emergency can do the difference.Pros: this place is closed to a lots of restaurants town center and beaches Cons: this place it‚Äôs not so private at all . there is a 2 floor house just next to it .
50086197,Rene,March,2022,Very clean. and private. A place to relax. Definitely we go again
50086197,Ricardo J.,March,2022,Expect a peaceful and relaxing stay. Great for resting and reconecting.
50086197,Sarah,March,2022,Amazing place!! Super cute. clean. and a quick commute into Rincon. The place was very comfortable and quaint. Also. the AC worked amazingly which felt great after a long Beach day. Not as private as we expected. but definitely worth the stay. Would highly recommend this place to any other couples planning a quick trip to Rincon! Thanks Nelson!!
50086197,Richard,February,2022,This place it‚Äôs great. The info is very accurate. very clean and cozy place to spend time with a love one or even if you want to discover Rinc√≥n. It‚Äôs very close to all amenities and downtown Rinc√≥n which has a large selection of places to eat and drink. We will definitely stay again.
50086197,Adiana,January,2022,My experience in this location was overall cozy but there minor details that could've made it better. The place is not entirely private. Before you go. make sure that the offers mentioned in the description are available. There wasn't any stove to make the meals. Some things required maintenance like the shower head needs a little more maintenance on adjusting it because it moves way too much and the surroundings of the container. The pool would've been better it had a heater because it was freezing! But overall the place is nice.
50086197,Orlando,January,2022,Almost perfect! Location. price. and aesthetics are great. The bathroom needs attention to details and a water heater for the pool would be great.
50086197,Astrid Denise Mar√≠a,December,2021,Place was nice. a little smaller than the pictures. is not that private. and it only has a 2 burners portable electric stove. but other than that we enjoyed our stay. Place is cozy. nice and peaceful. perfect for a couples retreat. üëçüèª
50086197,Veronica,December,2021,The home is perfect for couples and those who need a place to chill after a trip to the beach. Very clean. Host was responsive when we had questions. Great experience.

50086197,Guillermo,October,2021,Great area great bed. great host he informs you of check in promptly and keeps in touch. If you plan on staying local to San Juan it is 2hrs 25 mins away. I drove all over 3 hrs away at a time to run ATVs in Carabal√≠ forest. To see the black sand beach one hour from Carabal√≠ forest In Luquillo. Which is 3 hrs from rincon. Plenty to do in Rinc√≥n I was going to scuba dive but the waters weren‚Äôt in my favor. Received a full refund no issues given wasn‚Äôt my fault. Don‚Äôt eat at the English rose. Old San Juan be ready for traffic was nice to sight see n shop. Roads are small colonial streets I would not stay in old San Juan.  Which is also like 3hrs from rincon. Great stay. Great privacy great pool great food. The hub a street guy same street and side of la papa restaurant it‚Äôs a trailer with PR BBQ get there before 2pm they run out quick. I believe it‚Äôs called conyaso. Awesome area great people also gas says 88 cents that‚Äôs per Litter not gallon
50086197,Jonathan,October,2021,Great place! Having a private pool makes it worth it. Very calm and quiet neighborhood and near the public plaza of Rincon.

Cleanliness and smell get 5 stars. And not to mention the location. It is close to many tourist and gastronomic things in Rincon. The only thing I would change about this beautiful place is the fact that I could not enjoy the pool because it was very cold. for this type of place where the Airbnb is located. a heater is needed for the pool. And on the other hand. the base of the shower requires a slight adjustment. Mostly 100% recommended.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

50086197,Jose,October,2021,The place itself is cozy and the pool is perfect . at night the atmosphere is magical .the host was kind .but it lacked too much cleanliness . there were places with a lot of dust and others with hair . the cushions that are in the pool area have even mold .the shower had many dirty parts. In the bathroom. the floor stains and the one in front of the door also because it was raining and it got wet. The floor is complicated since everything that touches it stains. There is privacy at times because from the balcony of the host's house you can see the entire Airbnb pool area. And finally our check-out was at 11am and before that time there were some workers doing the surrounding courtyard and thanks to that we had to leave the pool area because everything was full of grass and there were a lot of small stones bouncing around. I understand that I'm supposed to wait for no one to be in the apartment to do it since it's not at all comfortable and it was within my hours of stay.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

50086197,Response from Nelson,July,2021,Greetings Genuine. I'm sorry about that. However. we already added some metal doors on every corner. since no animals or anyone will be able to enter. with a key and security. It was something that was in the process of being implemented. but it took some time for the doors to be created. About cleaning. the pool is paid for maintenance of it. and we live in a tropical area. always a little dust will come in. But it's clean and we make sure that. The cleaning thing in Vag√≥n. what we want is for you to keep it. wash the dishes. leave the area organized. etc. But we're going to put a broom even if it is. Thank you.Show moreTranslated¬†¬†Show original

10072034,Kurtis,April,2016,Serenity is an amazing and relaxing place. I had a wonderful time here. I was upgraded to the King Deluxe #3 which is beautiful. spacious and very quiet. I enjoyed Serenity so much that I extended my stay an additional 2 nights for a total of 5 nights. The last 2 nights were in the Queen Supreme #15 which was also very nice. Additionally. Sara is fabulous and full of ideas about what to do in the Rincon area and beyond. I enjoyed the breakfast she prepared each morning. That was a great way to start the day. The hot tub and relaxing common areas were also a nice touch. I highly recommend staying at Serenity and will stay again next time I'm in Puerto Rico!
10072034,Nicola And Luna,April,2016,Serenity was the perfect place for our weekend trip to Rincon. It's in a very quiet and natural area. yet a short walk to Sandy beach.

Sara was so helpful and friendly when we were looking for things to do!
10072034,Erin,March,2016,Serentity was a gem of a hotel! Nestled in the hill above Sandy Beach. it is newly constructed and run by the lovely. helpful Sara. Serenity is perfectly situated- it is a quick walk to the beach and nice short strip of restaurants and shops. Or. a very short drive to all the other beaches and activities of Rincon. The room itself was great- we stayed in Studio 15 that had all the amenities promised: comfy bed. cold AC. fridge. coffee maker. kitchenette. nice new bathroom. and cute decor. It exceeded our expectations for the price point. Sara was very helpful with recommendations and clearly pays attention to the small details that made our stay so special.

10072034,Dave,February,2016,Beautiful hotel- definitely a great spot to stay in when visiting Rincon.
10072034,Jonathan,February,2016,Place is a little hard to find but I knew the area well. The room is simple but well decorated more than a enough for a short a stay. only complaint is that the wi-fi didn't work in the room and that the flat screen tv didn't have any channels.

11848127,Christian,December,2022,Convenient and in an absolute great location. Mily and her team does a great job to get you started off on the right foot. Rincon felt like home. Place is amazing and having this place with Mily made the experience that much more special. Look no further. As I get older I appreciate when things are easy. This was easy and flawless.
11848127,Enrique,November,2022,always good
11848127,Nino,October,2022,Mily‚Äôs place was perfect for my wife and I to unwind after our wedding. Everything was exactly as described in the listing. The location was ideal. just steps away from Sandy Beach. Not sure there were people staying in 2 other units. but if so. it still felt extremely private. The pool is beautifully maintained. Communication with Mily was excellent from start to finish. The only recommendation I would have is to bring a fire stick or chromecast if you want to watch something other than what‚Äôs on cable. but after a long day at the beach. we made due with Hallmark movies. Definitely recommend!
11848127,Felix,July,2022,The place is close to the beach and there are a few restaurants mear by too. The place was very ckean and Milly was super responsive.
11848127,Jessica,May,2022,Mily‚Äôs place was just as expected. Fantastic location. near several restaurants. easy parking. amaaaazing pool. and really nice apartment! We loved it and have already recommended it to friends.
11848127,Lynn,May,2022,We had a lovely stay at Red Palm celebrating our anniversary. All of the reviews are spot on. Cleanliness. location. thoughtful amenities. privacy.  exceeded our expectations.
11848127,Natalia,April,2022,Our second stay at red palm rinc√≥n was amazing. as expected. Great location. close to the beach and restaurants. Very quiet and relaxing surroundings. The parking is always a plus. The room was very modern. clean. and spacious. even with a full kitchen. everything you'd want for a getaway! The pool is a hidden gem and bonus for the red palm rinc√≥n. I will definitely be staying here again as soon as possible!
11848127,Anthony,April,2022,You were amazing. Super friendly. welcomed us with fresh bakeries. The place is we super clean. no kids. no smoking. Pool was crystal clear everyday and perfect location to Sandy beach. But still off the strip enough not to deal with kids and parties. Loved it and will be back.  Remember respect is everything. So respect their property!
11848127,Howard,March,2022,This is the 4th time staying at Red Palm. we will always try to stay here while in the area.
11848127,Martin,March,2022,Apartment exactly as described and pictured in the listing.  Mily is an excellent host and a great communicator. Location to Sandy Beach is perfect as too are the restaurants and bars close by.
11848127,Michael,March,2022,Mily‚Äôs place is perfect. great location. only a block from the beach. Very clean place. Comfortable bed. The shower isn‚Äôt the best but I think that‚Äôs a usual for Rincon. Close to wonderful bars with friendly bartenders and best burgers around.
11848127,Teresa,February,2022,Place was great. very modern and clean. Location was PERFECT. My only complaint was the shower. The water was either freezing or scolding hot. we could not get it somewhere in the middle. Also. the water pressure was very very weak. Half the trip I used the outdoor shower because the pressure was a tiny bit better out there. Still a great place and would definitely recommend.
11848127,Michelle,February,2022,The location is amazing!! Nice quiet. clean and everything you need for a getaway. Perfect for a couple!
11848127,Liza,January,2022,Mily's place was absolutely perfect for our stay in Rincon. Minutes walk to the beach. coffee shop. beach shops. and more. The apartment had a comfy bed and full kitchen so we were able to pick up some groceries to make our own breakfast! We enjoyed our breakfast by the pool and caught some sun before we started the day. We really appreciated the extra amenities like beach towels. chairs. and coolers. Would definitely stay there again!
11848127,Madeline,January,2022,Mily was an amazing host during our stay in Rincon. The apartment was better than expected from what we could see in the photos. It was the perfect walking distance to the beach and many food and bar areas. We loved the pool. deck.  location. safety. and security of the property. As an added bonus we also were pleasantly surprised to be able to use the beach chairs. beach towels. and cooler. On top of all that. Mily was extremely responsive and helpful during the entire process. She met us to give a full tour at check in and also facilitated our early morning (2 am!!) check-out. We will definitely be planning another stay. and would recommended the Red Palm to many friends. Thank you again!!!-Madeline & Timothy
11848127,Nick,December,2021,The location was fantastic and an easy walk to the beach as well as a couple of restaurants.  It is a short car ride into town.  The place was exactly what we needed.  You won‚Äôt be able to cook extensively but let there are some basics if you want to do breakfast or a simple meal.  We would definitely stay here again and appreciated the responsive communication from the host.
11848127,Nancy,December,2021,beautiful location. you can go snorkeling 8 minutes away. great beach for surfing within walking distance.
11848127,Suzanne,November,2021,Lovely unit in a great location! We were looking for a sleepy part of town to primarily go surfing every day and this was the perfect spot. There were a few small restaurants and shops within walking distance. everything else was a short drive. We mostly opt to cook instead of dining out and the kitchen was equipped with everything we needed with the BBQ being a great addition. The pool was clean and refreshing after being in the hot sun all day. Hope to visit again and rent out the entire building with friends.
11848127,Ted,October,2021,Awesome experience. we would definitely come back
11848127,Christine,September,2021,Nice property. clean with all the amenities needed. Modern apartment and nice pool. Very close to beautiful Sandy Beach. Mily was a great host.
11848127,Nilda,August,2021,Excellent placeüòéIngrid and Mily  very nice.
11848127,Myri,July,2021,Red Palm Rincon was as beautiful in person as it was in the pictures. We had a little trouble finding the Airbnb but we came in at night and could not see the actual sign. Milly met us and helped with our check in. The space is immaculate! From the amazing artwork. the pool right outside our door. and available beach chairs and coolers. we were in heaven. The beach is literally a short walk (like 2 mins) away. There are a few restaurants near Red Palm and we also took advantage of eating at local eateries in Aguadilla which is the next town over. The bedroom as central air which makes for a cozy night's rest. There was no noise at night which was peaceful. We were able to meet another couple who was staying in one of the suites and had fun at the pool. I would recommend this place to anyone. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thanks Milly!
11848127,Alex,July,2021,Perfect location and great host. Everything you need. Highly recommended.
11848127,Martin,July,2021,Simply amazing! From the check in. thru the suggestion for eateries. to the seamless check out. This place has set a whole new standard for hospitality. Thank you!!
11848127,Jason,July,2021,This place was gorgeous. and in a great location. about a block from the beach. Mily met us for check-in. providing a tour of the property. including all of the amenities. Mily was very attentive. checking in daily to make sure our stay was positive. she even brought over local pastries from Rinc√≥n one evening. Overall. we had a great time. everything we needed was in the unit. to include beach chairs. a cooler. beach towels. coffee maker. etc. The biggest thing in my opinion. is that the property had a high-powered generator. which proved to be a lofe-saver during a rolling blackout in the area for a couple days over the fourth. We still had A/C and a fully functioning unit because of it.We would definitely stay here again
11848127,Samantha,July,2021,We loved our stay here! The location is really convenient. It‚Äôs right across the street from Sandy Beach. The Red Palm has chairs and coolers you can take to the beach as well and I can‚Äôt tell you how great it was to be able to run back to the apartment if we forgot something. Steps beach is down the road for Snorkeling as well. There are also several restaurants in walking distance. The apartment itself is modern. clean and spacious. I especially loved the rain shower and the pebble floor. We also came during the off season when power outages are common. the generator worked very well and we had no issues with losing electricity. I will say that the generator is a little loud. but it is a generator so that‚Äôs to be expected. Check in was easy and Mily/Ingrid gave us some great recommendations. I would definitely stay here again!
11848127,Mauricio,June,2021,It was the perfect vacation! The spot is at a great location with the beach just steps away and local bars around the perimeter. Very happy to have stayed at red palm as Mily was very helpful and was always attentive to our needs. Will definitely stay here again!
11848127,Tammy,June,2021,The place is very comfortable and we really enjoyed the location. Rincon is very relaxing and being across from Sandy Beach was especially convenient. This is a very nice place for a couple to relax and rest - exactly what we were looking for.
11848127,Erica,April,2021,We had a great time in Rincon and Mily‚Äôs place was the main reason why. The location is perfect.the beach is near by. Mily‚Äôs palce was super chic.clean and cozy. Mily was really attentive and the communication with her was extremely nice and easy. We‚Äôre looking forward to staying in the near future!
11848127,Sergey,April,2021,This was our very first time in PR. I must say this was one of our favorite mini get aways. Mily‚Äôs place was very nice and very clean. A few steps away from the beach and a few nice places to hang out and eat. The pool is a very nice touch. although there were two other couples occupying other apartments. we barely encountered anyone. Apartment we stayed in was a very good size for the two of us with everything we needed. including a nice treat that Mily was so kind to bring over.When visiting Rincon I would suggest going for at least 7-10 days. there are so many places and beaches to explore. I suggest taking a few day trips in order to enjoy western PR. We only spent 3 days there and are hopeful to come back soon to explore many more small villages. We had visited Crash Boat beach in Aguadilla which was about 45 min NE of Rincon. I suggest bringing your own snorkeling gear. there is a sunken ship to the left of the beach. which is full of tropical fish. An awesome thing to do on your own if you are a good swimmer and had snorkled in the past. it‚Äôs right of the beach where you can stand or swim. The water is crystal clear and the beach is very clean. Get out there as early as possible. the beach is small and they only allow a small amount of people there. There were vendors with food and drinks. delicious empanadas and some great drinks are available for cash or Venmo! Bring loads of sunscreen too! Another awesome place to visit is Paraguera. it‚Äôs about 1.5-2hr drive SW. There we found a boat rental spot! It‚Äôs about $35 an hour. you get a simple boat with a motor for 6 people max. and take it put to the surrounding mini islands. There you can just moor your boat and hang out in a waist deep water with others. You are surrounded by crystal clear water and small islands with mangroves. I‚Äôd spend majority of the day on this paradise. Make sure to bring cooler with ice. drinks. food and loads of sunscreen.Majority of nearby restaurants were opened on the weekends. we went to flamboyant which was a good spot for local/home made foods. If you like fresh tuna and bagels. it is a MUST to visit the bagel shop that‚Äôs about a 5 min walk from the apartment. The Wanderingbagel is famous for their amazing sushi bagel. it is just awesome!  They accept cash/Venmo. There is a small coffee shop right underneath the bagel shop that offers coffee/smoothies/a√ßa√≠ bowls! We visited several beaches in Rincon. there aren‚Äôt many sandy areas to walk into the water. definitely bring water shoes! Over all an amazing time and we are planning to be back soon.Show more
11848127,Jill,April,2021,Miley‚Äôs place was a great location to walk to Tamboo. Isalena Inn and a few other local cafes.  The apartment is not oceanfront. it is 2 blocks off the water.  The pool was a nice amenity after hiking each day!  Bring cooking stuff if you are going to cook at home.  There‚Äôs no oil or foil. spices and such.  Use All Trails app to find some great hikes!
11848127,Jose,March,2021,Mily‚Äôs place is a gem; very clean. comfortable and stylish.  The apartment has all you need to have a wonderful time in Rincon.  It is close to ocean front restaurants. stores and bars.  The pool and amenities of the Red Palm provides relaxation after a day under the sun and exploring Rinc√≥n.
11848127,Tahvia,February,2021,Astrid and Mily were very friendly and fast communicators. We had a great time at the Red Palm and were actually given some cool spots to go to and nice beaches to relax on. The place was modern and clean with a spunky touch. Overall great trip and great location. Loved being in nature but yet still so modern and new. Thanks Mily!
11848127,Viviana,February,2021,Great location. really clean space with a cool decor and great amenities like a pool and kitchen.
11848127,Omer,January,2021,I think the best part of the space is Mily and her quick response and hospitality. she went out of her way to help me. And the space is self contained with pool and kitchen so it's a vacation on its own. well located to beach and nice local restaurants too.
11848127,Crystel,January,2021,Wonderful property! So private and close to the beach. We felt like we had our own private pool for the whole week. Such a stylish Villa too. Truly a wonderful vacation. Mily was an outstanding host. very attentive.  helpful. and personable. We cait wait for our next visit to Red Palm in Rincon PR.  My new favorite island!
11848127,Cameron,January,2021,Perfect place for my wife and I!
11848127,Rosario,October,2020,Loved how it was closed to the beach

11848127,Melani,October,2020,Red Palm #2 unit was exactly as shown in the photos.  Very spacious and exceeded my expectations of cleanliness.  It was spotless and comfortable.   It had everything we might need. beach chairs. cooler. beach towels... Very nice small private pool. super cleanAstrid and Mily were extremely helpful when we arrived showing us the property and how to use the pool. lights. etc. They also helped us with a reservation in a local restaurant; Thank you!There were places around us to eat and the beaches were in a good distance.  Definitely would recommend this property for anyone visiting Rinc√≥n.
11848127,Carlos,October,2020,The house is urban-chic. comfortable. attractive. in a peaceful neighborhood. with lots of amenities and a swimming pool. It's near some of the best bars and restaurants. and a 5 minutes walk to Sandy Beach. It felt like a honeymoon and we surely will want to return.
11848127,Jose Andres,September,2020,Amazing place! Will come again soon!

11848127,Celeste,June,2020,Amazing location. facilities and amenities. Mily was very responsive. made the check-in process very easy. and gave us a tour of the place. We stayed at the apartment located in the middle section of the building. It was very clean and we just had to bring food for cooking because the kitchen was fully equipped. The master bedroom was comfortable. AC worked perfectly and the TV had satellite cable. The bathroom was impeccable. beautiful and comfortable space. Walking distance to the beach and the area was safe. We will definitely come back.
11848127,Nicole,February,2020,Check in and communication was very easy. The location is ideal and we appreciated the use of beach chairs. Our family of 3 had a fine time staying at Mily's place. though it is probably best suited for 2. which we were told is typically what is reserved. Rincon is an awesome area and we were so busy each day we didn't get to take advantage of the plunge pool. but how nice to have that available!
11848127,Reynolds,February,2020,Mills place was exceptional. Great location full of local restaurants and bars. She was one of the best hosts I have stayed with. The apt was beautiful and stylish.
11848127,Gilberto,January,2020,Fantastic place! The apartment was stylish. comfortable. and we found it immaculately clean. We loved the location just a few steps from a really nice beach (popular with surfers) and one of the best beach bars in the Island. I also enjoyed walking to a nice outdoor yoga studio that offered classes daily. There were good options for food within walking distance. but we were happy to have a car rental that gave us easier access to the culinary experiences Rinc√≥n has to offer. Mily was a great host. attentive and responsive. and gave us excellent advice on places to visit and things to do. It was a great experience overall; we would love to stay again. no doubt.
11848127,Rob,December,2019,We had a great experience staying at Mily‚Äôs place in Rincon. The accommodation is in the nicest part of Rincon in my opinion and the place itself is clean. modern and has an amazing pool area.All in all we had an amazing trip. thank you Mily.

11848127,Keeley,February,2019,Location is awesome. right across the street from a really nice beach and restaurant. but still quiet at night. Mily was super responsive to everything we needed. Pool area was lovely and a great place to hangout if the beach was too windy. Cookies and juice were a nice touch!
11848127,Response from Mily,February,2019,I‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience of the noise unfortunately the neighbor had electrical problems and he had to run his generator in order to have electricity. They are working and fixing the situation tomorrow. Always a pleasure!Show more

Mily is excellent. was available 24/7 for us and answer all our questions. The apartment was beautiful. clean. spacious and well equipped. Definitely coming back.
11848127,Rosario,June,2018,A beautifully appointed contemporary oasis amid the beach vibes of Sandy beach. The property is spotlessly clean and boasts a gorgeous pool area and it is just a one minute walk to the beach and the most beautiful sunsets on the island. Mily. the hostess was very friendly. and communicated quickly to make sure we were ok prior to our arrival.
11848127,Juan,April,2018,Great place and private.
11848127,Stuart,January,2017,beautiful little apartment with all needed for a short stay. 100m to an amazing beach and great bar with chilled surfer vibe but also all ages. Beach is gorgeous and perfect for either swimming or surfing but very dependant on wind strength. sometimes good for both. can highly recommend for a slightly off the beaten track getaway which still gives you access to all you need. Car needed for shopping is about all.
11848127,Aramid,July,2022,Very cozy. clean. modern and has all the necessary equipment for a beach vacation. Chairs. refrigerators. outdoor shower.

30205821,Response from Alan And Eileen,August,2022,Gabrielle. we are thrilled you enjoyed your stay and want to thank you for writing such a lovely review. Please come back and visit us soon!
30205821,Nicole,March,2022,We loved the space - very thoughtful and has a great patio space that is shaded in the morning! I love the eco-friendly elements.
30205821,Thomas,March,2022,Great spot!
30205821,Kristen,February,2022,The Beach Pad is worth booking if for no other reason than the service/communication aspect. Alan always responded to our questions from looking for a late night open restaurant when we knew we‚Äôd be arriving late to helping with a parking situation. And when we decided we wanted to extend our time in Rincon an extra day. we were able to book another unit with Alan‚Äôs assistance. The unit(s) (because we‚Äôve now stayed in nearly half of the building ;) ) are pristine clean and filled with every comfort of home you could think of. The location is THE best.. it‚Äôs a three minute walk to Sandy Beach or Pools. You can walk to several bar/restaurants- as well as morning coffee. The walls are dense- you won‚Äôt hear your neighbor. but- you may hear music from the nearby burger bar into the night. which wasn‚Äôt a bother to us at all. The second half of our stay was on the east side of the island at a 5 star resort and we MUCH preferred the Beach Pad. The only thing worth knowing is the water supply is heated by solar panels- early morning showers are not your best bet if you‚Äôre looking for a hot water. But- hop in after your time at the beach or in the evening and you‚Äôll be set!Also- if you‚Äôre staying in the area. please take a walk down to the street towards the ‚Äúpool bar sushi‚Äù (permanently closed) in Google maps. Before you get there. you‚Äôll see a beautiful. skinny horse with the personality of a golden retriever in an enclosure. Please ensure he has food (hay) and water during your stay. Both myself and another tourist supplied him during our week stay after realizing his owners were not. I contacted Defensa but am not sure what came of it‚Ä¶Show more
30205821,Jonathan,December,2021,Great spot. Love it. The communications was great. Love to come back again.
30205821,Rita,December,2021,Lovely place to stay and the hosts were super nice and responsive. It was really nice to have the beach chairs and towels that we could use. along with lots of other thoughtful touches. The location is great - Puntas is a fun and beautiful area and you can walk to the beach and several good places to eat. although I'd recommend a car to see more of Rincon.
30205821,Nyreen,July,2021,The Beach Pad is an excellent place to stay. perfectly located next to the beach and very clean.  Alan and Eileen are the perfect hosts.
30205821,Katie,March,2021,Best location. extremely clean and Alan and Eileen are the BEST! Grab a spot while you can.
30205821,Ben,March,2021,So many cephalopods! Watched My Octopus Teacher. felt weird. Lovely place.
30205821,Jayna,February,2021,This place is awesome. My husband and I left the kids at home this time and these cozy little loft spaces are PERFECT. Walking distance to Sandy Beach and several awesome restaurants. Coffee mornings on our own private terrace listening to the birds chirp and the island breeze. Alan + Eileen are amazing hosts. There was NOTHING the left out (and we are picky and have spent lots of time in Rincon). We will be back!!!
30205821,Matthew,February,2021,This was one of our favorite Airbnb‚Äôs on our 21 day stay in Puerto Rico! Absolutely everything you could ever need or want was provided. Fully equipped kitchen. lovely outdoor space. wonderful and thoughtful amenities galore. Perfect location. recommendations. and absolutely amazing hosts! Stop looking and get booking. You can‚Äôt go wrong at this perfect spot in Rincon! We will definitely be back.
30205821,Alice,January,2021,Amazing location. clean . well appointed. neat brand new apartment. Solidly stocked kitchen (variety of utensils. toaster. etc.) and spacious shaded (!) balcony. FYI. more of a studio than a one bedroom. Bed and couch both comfy. Hosts were super helpful in resolving issues.
30205821,Taylor,November,2020,This was my first time staying in Rinc√≥n and I am happy I got to spend it at The Beach Pad.  It is a very clean. comfortable. and stylish place.  It has everything you need to stay for a weekend or longer.  Alan and Eileen even provided an Ipad with a Rinc√≥n guidebook containing activities and restaurant recommendations which were very helpful.  We were within walking distance to several great surf areas. and restaurants and only a short drive to downtown Rinc√≥n.  We hope to return to this peaceful corner of the island very soon.
30205821,Tom,November,2020,Bright. open and airy. and equipped with everything needed for a tropical beach vegetable away. The patio was a great place to have coffee in the morning and sit and listen to the coquis at night. Steps from the beach and restaurants. Strong WiFi helped to get the work done when needed! Alan was quick to respond to questions and offered a late checkout.  I‚Äôll be back!
30205821,Wigberto,October,2020,We really enjoyed our stay at the beachpad. The decor and style was on point. We actually used the kitchen area and found it had everything to cook up a few meals (except the specific seasonings). A/C functioned perfectly and there was hot water. Sandy beach is a 5 minute walk away. Internet worked flawlessly and gave speeds of 190 mbps download and 20 mbps upload which is more than enough to work remotely and stream movies.
30205821,Lymarie,October,2020,Excellent!!
30205821,Bethel,August,2020,Impeccably clean and thoughtful special attention to details. From reservations. to our room at Pulpo Loco. my family thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we'll highly recommend it.Owners. Allan and Eileen were available for questions. Their service was very attentive and friendly. Our vacation was Excellent at The Beach Pad! Thank you!
30205821,Response from Alan And Eileen,March,2020,Thank you for the fabulous review Amanda! We are glad you enjoyed your stay at The Beach Pad.
30205821,Response from Alan And Eileen,January,2020,Thank you for the wonderful review! We are glad you enjoyed your stay at The Beach Pad and Rincon. We hope to host you again soon.
30205821,Shelby,December,2019,This place was the perfect location and the house was adorable! We would come back in a heart beat!Response from Alan And EileenJanuary 2020Thank you for the wonderful review Shelby! We are happy you enjoyed your stay at The Beach Pad. We hope to host you again soon!
30205821,Response from Alan And Eileen,January,2020,Thank you for the wonderful review Shelby! We are happy you enjoyed your stay at The Beach Pad. We hope to host you again soon!
30205821,Orlando,June,2019,I found the property very clean. I also found it to be very technology friendly and properly equipped with everything I needed for my stay. I would stay here again.
30205821,Nicole,April,2019,The Beach Pad is perfect! It is a perfect location for families or couples! We have been traveling to Puerto Rico for several years now and this has by far been our favorite place. We loved our unit and it was immaculate upon arrival. We had everything we needed. There are plenty of dishes. silverware. etc. The fridge was perfect to hold everything we needed. The microwave and electric stovetop were an added bonus. This gave us an option to eat and cook at the unit.  The unit also has beach towels along with bath towels and a cooler for use. which was just what we needed. The bathroom has soap. shampoo. and conditioner plus a hair dryer. so you don‚Äôt need to carry your own.  The shower also had hot water which was great. that is often hard to come by if you haven‚Äôt traveled here before. The WiFi and Netflix worked great if you need it and the iPad in the unit comes with a beautifully detailed book of everything you need to know about the area. from restaurants. to beaches. to excisions. to the nearest grocery store. You can‚Äôt go wrong with the Beach Pad. We loved it and will definitely be returning in the future!!!
30205821,Manuel,April,2019,The apartment is in a great location near restaurants. bars and the beach.  It is well decorated and clean.  Beautiful view from the balcony.  Highly recommended.  I'll be staying again when I return to Rincon.
30205821,Harold,April,2019,Simply awesome.
30205821,Alexandra,February,2019,This place is amazing. The location is a super plus since it has so much amazing places walking distance. We would definitely stay here again.
30205821,Dana,February,2019,We had an amazing time at Alan and Eileen's! It was my boyfriend and I staying in the Pulpo Loco suite. You cannot beat the location-- right across from Casa Verde. a few steps away from Sandy Beach and some bars/restaurants. The suite itself was a great size for us. Nothing bad to say about our trip-- everything was wonderful and we will definitely be back!
30205821,Logan,January,2019,Perfect pad for the perfect escape!  Awesome location. great people. beautiful house and beaches!
30205821,Lorraine,February,2022,FABULOUS apartments and the area where it is. really PARADISE.Translated from Portuguese¬†¬†Show original
30205821,Amarelis,September,2020,Alan and Eileen's is excellent. We recommend it 100%. Excellent location. it has everything you need for a pleasant stay. it is well cleaned and tastefully decorated.  We'll be back soon.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
657397001373614779,Ken,July,2022,Very spacious. clean. and well-laid out home. The location (jut a couple blocks from the plaza) was awesome. The owner is a very congenial and thoughtful host. and I doubt one could do better than to stay in this home if your goal is to plug into la comunidad de Rinc√≥n.
657397001373614779,Heidie,July,2022,It's been a great experience! I went with my son and my twin brother's family and there was plenty of space for everyone. The house is big. newly renovated. clean and fully equipped with extras. You don't have to bring anything. but your personal belongings and what you want to eat at the house. It was at walking distance to the downtown. restaurants (any type) to eat and drink what ever you desire. The municipal beach is at almost half a mile ( .47 miles) so you can walk too. It is near many beaches in Rinc√≥n. Aguada. Aguadilla etc.. Or to water park as Las Cascadas. There are many shoppings. stores and supermarkets very close. The owner was polite. welcoming and had beach equipment as beach cooler. chairs. googled. ball...The place had air-conditioning in the entire house and if the electricity service it's down it have solar system so you have energy. We are very pleased and happy with the place and host!! Thank you again Richard!!! I hope to return to celebrate my doctoral degree soon. Wait for us!!
657397001373614779,Emeterio,July,2022,Excellent facilities. very good location !! The truth is that we are very grateful for the attention and above all that we enjoyed the stay !! Regards from MexicoTranslated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original

35674073,Heather,December,2022,Katya‚Äôs place was beautiful. i felt right at home! Everything was clean and the space was very peaceful. I especially loved the indoor/outdoor living ‚Ä¶ i was able to yoga right on the deck every morning! The projector was an unexpected touch but actually quite nice to have at night. On the rare occasion i needed her. she was extremely responsive. I would recommend this place to anyway looking for R&R and will certainly be back.
35674073,Eric,December,2022,Great view and peaceful location. Been to Rincon many times and prefer to stay closer to downtown Rincon.
35674073,Glorymar,November,2022,Beautiful place. good location. amazing views.
35674073,Anabel,November,2022,An amazing place to be. Beautiful and peaceful. I totally recommend!!!
35674073,Paul,November,2022,Dramatic views . clean architecture and comfortable furnishings. Very relaxing!
35674073,Jes√∫s,November,2022,This penthouse is amazing. very spacious and comfortable for a couple. The view is magnificent and can be seen from everywhere in the apartment. Katya was great and helped us with everything need for our reservation.
35674073,Rebeca,October,2022,Awesome host! Awesome views! Everything was perfect and clean!
35674073,Shane,September,2022,We had an incredible stay at Katyas penthouse! The views were incredible and we loved the location and it‚Äôs distance to steps beach. tres palmas marina and Rincon city center! The pool was fantastic and we loved the tropical landscaping in the yard below the pool. We will definitely be back and would love to stay here again!!
35674073,Ilibette,August,2022,This place was absolutely stunning! The view is breathtaking!! My favorite part was the balcony & view. my  boyfriend and I would have breakfast out there every morning. It was so peaceful and relaxing. The bed was comfortable & the shower was also great! We watched tv using the projector one night which was really cool!! Getting there the first day was a little tricky but Katya gave us instructions and we made it safely‚Ä¶after that we were in and out without a problem. The pool was also very clean. we used it once because we spent most of our days visiting different beaches.. it‚Äôs located in a great area near lots of attractions.
35674073,Paul,August,2022,Very nice stay. Everything we needed and more. Would highly recommend 10/10
35674073,Manuel,July,2022,Amazing place with amazing views. clean. comfortable and what a terrace
35674073,Rey Alexis,July,2022,It was an amazing time! I want to go back and stay for more days!!
35674073,Francisco,July,2022,Great stay. great view.
35674073,Kimberly,July,2022,I needed a last-minute rental as the Airbnb I had booked was not as advertised. Katya was so easy to work with and had us in the place within a few hours. I highly recommend. Incredible views. gorgeous home. and wonderful host!
35674073,Response from Katya,June,2022,Hi Susana. Just read your review and wanted to apologize for the firmness of the mattress. Since this is my personal space the mattress is accommodated to my preferences as you understand. I. on the other hand. get severe back pain from softer beds. Most of my clients love the hard mattress as well and some even say it was the best sleep of their life. I guess there are two kinds of people - soft mattress and hard mattress. It's impossible to satisfy both. Thank you for your understanding of that.  All the best. KatyaShow more
35674073,Christopher,June,2022,Amazing place with spectacular views. Everything about the house was perfect. Would definitely stay here again.
35674073,Silvestre,June,2022,When staying at this property you will be staying at a transitional neighborhood. surrounded by an abandoned hotel building and ran down properties that are in less than Ok conditions. The pent house is right next to a house that was packed with abandoned cars that would also blast loud music and loud party gatherings up to late hours in the evening.The house sits on top of a hill that is difficult to access and that you can only get to by car. Getting in and out of the property parking was very challenging and it felt dangerous. More so the pavement right in front of the drive way is in very poor conditions which could lead to tire damage or getting stuck (as advised by the owner). Forget about walking to the beach. it would take you good 40 minutes to get to the beach if you decided to walk and a very steep uphill hike back to the house. The nice sliding glass doors that you see in the pictures do not lock and the pent house balcony can be easily accessed through a ledge between the driveway and the balcony.The mattress was extremely firm. with not enough sheets or blankets to make one feel comfortable. The rental only provided access to beach towels which felt short of expectations when compared with other properties at this price point. During our stay the owners requested to enter the property to get a printer that was left inside the pent house. The request felt out of place and not customer service oriented especially when charging premium prices through our stay.Overall we felt remote/unsafe. uncomfortable and unwelcome to the point that we decided to check out one day earlier due to the inconveniences we experienced.Show more
35674073,Chad,June,2022,The penthouse is fantastic. Every time we stay it always feels like home away from home but with a better view.
35674073,Peter,June,2022,A beautiful home with an amazing view. The pool and balcony are great and it‚Äôs a perfect location for exploring Rincon
35674073,Roman,May,2022,Katya‚Äôs place is incredible - it feels very open. has amazing views. and it‚Äôs nicely decorated and well maintained. And it‚Äôs just a short ride away from all the main beaches. Katya provided clear directions and instructions. Would definitely stay again.
35674073,Thomas,May,2022,Great location. lots of nature around and peaceful. English Rose cafe is very close by and is awesome! Balcony and sea views were incredible. Host was very responsive. Highly recommend.
35674073,Maria,January,2022,The experience was exceptional and the view is just a dream! Highly recommend for a quiet and peaceful time.
35674073,Meghan,December,2021,Beautiful home and location!
35674073,Varun,December,2021,Fantastic and peaceful retreat in the mountains located approximately 15 minute walk from the beach. Great views and serene accommodations. Will stay here again and definitely recommend the penthouse!
35674073,Maximilian,December,2021,Couldn't have imagined a more pleasant stay in Rincon - highly recommend on all accounts.
35674073,Ian,December,2021,Beautiful. relaxing space.. many thoughtful touches throughout.. amazing views from the deck.. very high quality materials used in the construction of the home.. very cozy bedroom w a firm but comfortable king size  bed.. nice pool area.. convenient laundry available.. gas kitchen w ample cookware.. located 10 minutes from town.. the driveway isn‚Äôt for beginners but other than that it was a great stay.. definitely recommend staying here if you‚Äôre looking for luxurious accommodations w a view!
35674073,Elva,December,2021,Appreciated the check in. Didn‚Äôt feel really clean when we got there. Be aware there are used belongings in the kitchen and restroom. Really liked the view during the day and at night.
35674073,Jessica,December,2021,We had a wonderful time in this house with the beautiful view!
35674073,Ivette,February,2021,The best place for vacation. Beaches are close and great restaurants. The ocean view from the apartment was outstanding. When you sleep at night you can fell being out side with the stars. Looking forward to return. Host was the best.
35674073,Antonio,February,2021,katya‚Äôs place is beautiful. it truly exceeded our expectations.  The view is breathtaking and every detail is well thought out.  The pool is very relaxing and everything was sparkling clean.We will definitely return!!
35674073,Jesiel,January,2021,This place is AMAZING!! The view and amenities can‚Äôt be beat ! There  are some scary hills to reach the property but I promise it‚Äôs worth it and you‚Äôll get used it .
35674073,Courtney,January,2021,Can‚Äôt rave enough about the location and design of this home. Loved the decor. and the view off the back deck! What an amazing stay up in the mountains. would absolutely return here in the future.
35674073,Hazel,January,2021,If you want views. a modern feel and proximity to the city center. look no further. Michelle is super sweet and friendly. she had a list of activities we could do in Rincon. She also had a list of local restaurants we could eat at. she is absolutely splendid and perfect. I will be back!!! I loved it!!
35674073,Mikhail,January,2021,Great views-beautiful place-I loved the open balcony
35674073,Ty,January,2021,The view is better than the pictures and the property is perfectly located in that it is a few mins drive to the surf. restaurants and local bars
35674073,Chenyao,January,2021,This pictures DO NOT do it justice! That was my first reaction when I walked into the penthouse. My bf and I were traveling around PR. and this was our last stop. Last stop. best stop. The house is so amazing ‚Äî I had to force myself to stop taking pictures every second since the view is so breathtaking from every angle and every hour. The amenities are so thoughtful and  well-designed. I got a lot of interior design inspirations from this house. too. The location is great. less than 10min away from most places. The drive was a bit scary at first...if you rent a small car. I recommend not taking the middle path up or down hill...I was a bit worried about insects problems because I got way too many mosquito bites in the mountains; however. to my surprise. although there are trees all around. there‚Äôs no bug.I could go on for another thousand words but. in short. we had such an absolutely awesome time in this house. It was the highlight of our 1 month trip and we are definitely going to go back next time!
35674073,Alexandra,January,2021,The view is amazing. The photos of the place are accurate. Cleanliness is pretty bad. The floors were dirty when we got there. The dishes in the dishwasher and the towels in the master bedroom were dirty. The bathrooms had a pee smell. The pillows in the sofa. the windows. the curtains and the lamps were full of dust. I'm very allergic so I was sneezing the whole time. Also. the matress is very stiff and it almost felt like we were sleeping in the floor. We ended up with back pain and happy to be home so we could sleep in a comfortable bed.
35674073,Jonathan,December,2020,Beautiful home in the hills! Breathtaking views and clean modern space. Loved the projector for movies. Comfortable bed. big windows. Great terrace. Loved it! A+++ ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è
35674073,Elisa,December,2020,Amazing views in a quiet and stylish space. We had a memorable stay. Highly recommended.
35674073,Joshua,December,2020,The best stay in Rincon. Away from the busy streets and beaches yet super accessible. It‚Äôs world class. Go for it.
35674073,Jose,December,2020,We went for our honeymoon. It is a great private place and close to many beaches and restaurants. It is great to enjoy a romantic sunset. Hospitality and services are great!
35674073,Anthony,November,2020,Excellent place. location and view.  Everything was spotless. the view of the ocean and skies was speechless. The place is very stylish and everything was in the right place.  Very close to all restaurant and downtown area.   Pool is shared but she make it work even with all the COVID restrictions.  No complains and we enjoyed the pool every day.  Beach‚Äôs were closed unfortunately but pool was available on certain times to allow physical distance from other guest.  Is a place to relax and have a good time with your love one. There is no TV and is hard to see during the day the projection system that was in place. Anyways you don‚Äôt go to look TV or show. You go for the views and to relax.   Recommended.
35674073,Carlos,November,2020,Excellent spot and amenities!!
35674073,Jimmy,November,2020,Very relax place beautyful view.
35674073,Sarah,February,2020,This apartment was more beautiful than I could have ever expected or asked for. I highly recommend staying here. For me and my boyfriend. it was absolutely perfect. We could both see ourselves living in a space like this forever. The pool is beautiful. the bed is so comfortable. the view is unbeatable. and I was located a few moments up the hill from our favorite breakfast spot. The host was so nice to us and friendly. The couple staying downstairs in the downstairs room was also so nice! We felt very lucky! Five stars all around.
35674073,Alan,February,2020,Stunning penthouse apartment with panoramic views.  Everything was as advertised or better.  Conveniently located to many of Rincon's beaches. restaurants and landmarks.  The hosts are very responsive and provide a comprehensive list of places to visit and things to do.  A great place to chill out and watch the sunset.
35674073,Laura,February,2020,Amazing views and a truly beautiful place.
35674073,Jaclyn,January,2020,If you are considering this place. stop wondering and just do it! You will be so happy you did.  I captured hundreds of Instagram worthy shots from every angle of this residence. The enormous balcony is great for bird watching. relaxing with morning coffee. or late-night beers.  both sunrise and sunset you get an amazing view of the sky and expansive water in the distance. Laying in bed at night. you feel like you're in a jungle paradise as the Coqui's sing you to sleep.
35674073,Hashem,January,2020,Great space as you can tell clearly from the photos. Really enjoyed staying here. Would book again for sure next time in Rincon. Thanks for nice list of recommendations. just what we needed.
35674073,Donal,December,2019,Great location in Rincon. The property has beautiful views and is modern inside. Check in/out was very smooth. Enjoyed our stay and would return.
35674073,John,December,2019,The place was truly amazing. wouldn't change a thing. The view is truly one of a kind and one of the best in RIncon. Would love to go back.
35674073,Cameron,November,2019,If you only read 1 review: read this one. The home is amazing. The finishes. the energy of the home. It can only be topped by the beautiful Rincon views. The mornings are ushered in my a cool breeze and eventually a rooster crowing. The days are quiet. peaceful and serene. The home is full of natural light. yet maintains a level of cool. The views from the balcony are movie scene worthy. The only thing that might top the views was out experience from our host. Michele was prompt. full of suggestions. and a kind hearted person. Patient and supportive. This place makes our short list of places to rebook in the future.
35674073,Monica,November,2019,We have no words to describe how gorgeous this place is. The view alone is a million dollar view. The unit is absolutely wonderful and has everything you need for your stay. Just bring your clothes! The unit comes equipped with beach towels. full fridge. wine fridge and every utensil you would need in the kitchen. including coffee machine and tea kettle. All cutlery and dining equipment is provided. Basic kitchen condiments and bath amenities are also provided. Air conditioned unit throughout. Water heater and pressure are great. For entertainment there is a music Bluetooth boomBox that also works for a wall projector to watch Netflix and other streaming media such as Fubo and YouTube. Although all you need is a glass of wine and the terrace to relax and watch the beautiful sunsets! The bed is super comfortable and has two different sets of pillows to choose from. Blackout drapes in the bedroom are a plus. The unit felt super clean and we would absolutely stay here again. The property contact. Michele. was also available to answer questions and received us in the property. She was very prompt answering questions. We recommend going to The English Rose for breakfast and recommend La Copa Llena. Estela. Mangia Mi and Reina Mora for dinner. For great craft beer go to Rincon Beer Company. For a great mixologist. go to El Taller speakeasy bar. For lunch go to La Cambija; they have the best fresh fish tacos and skewers. as well as fresh watermelon and ginger lemonade drinks. Go to Steps Beach to see sea turtles and beautiful schools of fish close to shore while snorkeling.Show more
35674073,Ryan,October,2019,The place is truly amazing great views from all around . The description is a little confusing says Penthouse but your literally only getting the top floor of a apartment and access to the pool
35674073,Zulmaris,October,2019,This is an amazing house to stay. Two of my favorites things. among others. were the salt water pool and the ocean view.
35674073,Lilly,October,2019,Spectacular!!! A modern/clean location with all amenities you need and more. The most amazing breathtaking sunset view in Rincon. Michelle the host was so helpful.

35674073,Dan,August,2019,This was our second stay at this spectacular house in a perfect location with a gorgeous view! It's contemporary design executed perfectly for its environment.  Katya and her team are meticulously attentive to details. and though we faced a particularly special challenge as a hurricane approached during our stay. the concern for our safety and the attention to our needs was beyond expectations.  This is truly a special place!
35674073,Ashley,August,2019,The place is beautiful!! The view is amazing and it‚Äôs easy to just stay on the property and not venture anywhere else. However there are plenty of restaurants beaches close by which made it easier to just hop up and go somewhere. The host was very helpful and made sure she kept in touch and made check In and checkout easy. If you are looking for a place to relax and chill away from the city ..this is it!!!
35674073,Luis,July,2019,This is a great property with very high-end finishes and details. You would need to drive to beaches and restaurants. but nevertheless it has a very good location and definitely a million-dollar view. Super clean and Michele. the manager. very helpful.
35674073,Noah,July,2019,I spent a week at Katya‚Äôs house and can‚Äôt wait to come back for another! It‚Äôs the perfect distance from town. giving you close access to beaches. but also the peacefulness of the hillsides of Rincon that you can‚Äôt get while staying across the street from all of the restaurants and nightlife. I‚Äôd definitely recommend staying here!
35674073,Maria,June,2019,The most beautiful space I saw in Puerto Rico! Apartment is huge. full of light and very well designed. Furniture. china. linen- just great. with fantastic taste. Paintings on the walls are designed especially for this apartment.The space has a  big open space living room. full kitchen. huge terrace with astonishing view. projector screen. netflix. Views of ocean are unbelievable.We had the best honeymoon weekend;)
35674073,Maria,June,2019,Katya's penthouse apartment was spectacular!  What an amazing place on the top of the hill! You can see the ocean from every spot in the apartment. It is very airy and modern! It has everything you would possibly need on vacation! My boyfriend and I felt very grateful and happy to find this gem of Rincon! Huge living room where we enjoyed our meals and watched movies at night. thanks to the projector screen that created a home cinema for us! Huge terrace around the entire apartment where we had our coffee in the morning! Spacious bedroom with luxurious mattress :)  you can't beat that! Amazing properties and wonderful swimming pool! If you are a couple looking to spend a few days in luxury or better a week - this is a place for you! Definitely coming back and recommending it to friends. Thank you. Katya!

40322835,Nicholas,December,2022,Had a lovely stay at Karl & Evelyn‚Äôs full 2nd floor APT! Location is excellent as a few steps from the beach and have a partial view of the ocean. You can also hear the waves at night. Only two comments: Noticed a few long hairs on the floor and in the bathroom - perhaps a one off bad cleaning. and the bathroom could use a little upgrade / remodeling. but the value for the APT is superb.
40322835,Josh & Brittani,November,2022,Highly Recommend!! Beautiful property and in a incredible location. quick walking distance to multiple beaches / surf spots . Very comfortable mattress and though no air-conditioning in main part of house . air conditioning is in bedroom and worked perfect!! Very wonderful and kind Host!

40322835,Response from Karl & Evelyn,July,2022,Although we have the beach and a few restaurants within walking distance. a car is highly recommended to explore the town of Rincon.  Local taxis are also an option.

40322835,Response from Karl & Evelyn,May,2022,Thank you for reviewing Kasa Maui.To clarify. the  beach is across the street from us and less than a 2 minute walk.

40322835,Alisha,May,2022,Amazing location! Steps away from sandy beach- easy access to swimming/surfing and quick walk to local restaurants and bars.

40322835,Samantha,March,2022,Kasa Maui is absolutely wonderful! Great location right across from a beautiful beach and surf spot. Walking distance to some restaurants/bars and a coffee shop or just a 5 minute drive to others. Also a short drive to downtown. Check in/out was very easy. Overall the property is very quaint and inviting. It‚Äôs also very clean and has everything you need. Our only wish is that we had stayed longer!

40322835,Amy,February,2022,Wonderful location and super responsive hosts. We had a great time !!
40322835,Parker,February,2022,If we could give Kasa Maui more than 5 stars we would! The home is not massive but it is the perfect size for a couples retreat. The proximity to the beach is nearly impossible to beat. The bed was very comfortable. the shower was warm with good water pressure. the kitchen had that we needed to prepare meals. Aside from the location to the beach. there are a couple of great restaurants/bars also within walking distance. Falling asleep and waking up to the sounds of waves crashing was delightful. Our only regret was not booking for longer. We would absolutely rebook Kasa Maui should we return to Rincon (if I have my way we will be back!!).
40322835,Danielle,February,2022,Kasa Maui is simply perfect! It‚Äôs clean. well maintained and in a great location.  Everything was better than expected and Karl & Evelyn were very responsive.  We can‚Äôt wait to stay there again!

40322835,Lori,November,2021,This home is located near several good surf breaks and very close to Sandy Beach.  Check in was easy.  The place is a little dark but that keeps it from heating up too much from the sun.  The bed was comfortable and you have a nice water view across the street.

40322835,Sarah,October,2021,Right across the street from Sandy Beach. Spacious. protected front yard / parking are with hammocks. Warm and cozy feel. nicely decorated. and clean.

Make sure to check out all the restaurants and businesses nearby too. Highly recommend for small groups. couples. or solo travelers.
40322835,Kevin,August,2021,Very cozy and although not on the water I thought it had a great view. Horses to one side and partial view of the water in front.

40322835,Leonard,July,2021,This place is a great value.  Very simple but complete accommodations across the street from a good quiet beach for relaxing or surf.  The whole house backup generator is A+ and Evelyn made sure the fuel tank for the generator never went empty during a four day power outage in the town.
40322835,Michael,June,2021,This house was perfect. The location is directly across the street from Sandy Beach. We spent most of our time on the beach. and could easily duck back to the house for the inevitable short afternoon rain. We would hangout in the hammocks or on the deck and then go right back to the beach after the rains passed.

40322835,Kelly,April,2021,This rental unit is absolutely perfect. We stayed upstairs. and our friends stayed downstairs. The covered patio is an absolute dream. especially if you need a break from the sun. We made steaks on the charcoal grill and just enjoyed the peaceful outdoors under the stars. I highly recommend booking this unit. especially if you can get some friends to rent the other one. It is truly an oasis. Thanks Karl & Evelyn!P.S. the beach is literally across the street
40322835,Meredith,April,2021,This apartment on the beach was stunning.

40322835,Lauren,March,2021,We had the best time on our trip. You might not be right on the beach with this property. but you are pretty darn close.

We were highly impressed with the cleanliness. and the hosts are very responsive. We will be back!

40322835,Response from Karl & Evelyn,September,2020,Thank You Adaliz for the lovely review and for choosing to stay with us.  We welcome you back anytime.
40322835,Response from Karl & Evelyn,August,2020,"From the moment this guy checked in. he was a problem.   Once he told me he found water in the fridge drawer he was immediately offered another unit and he declined.  After one night he contacted me and told me the fridge wouldn't close.  Seems like he didn't put the fridge drawer back properly and condensation set in.   After one night he was given the option to leave with a refund for the 2nd night and he opted to stay in the unit (he even requested a late check out the day he was leaving).  We did everything to accommodate this guest  including late check out and now i see his intention was probably to stay as long as he could or get a free stay.    We had a deep cleaning done prior to his arrival and had the fridge inspected after he left.  A 3 yr old probably could have figured out how to put the fridge draw back properly.  Never in any of the messages did he mention all these ""other"" issues.  Had he done that. I would have asked him to leave because i would have sensed where this experience was heading because of the bad vibes i got from him from the onset.Show more"

40322835,Mary,July,2020,This was perfect for my husband and I who are fitness enthusiasts. We were across the street from the beach called Sandy Beach. Each day we also explored one or two nearby beaches. local restaurants. and fruit and vegetable stands. It was great to have a kitchen to prep food for the days at the beach. We also used the host‚Äôs book full of ideas for surfing. and other activities such as the art walk and food trucks which were closed unfortunately . Perfect location if you like the beach. We ran each morning up the beautiful hills to see the Caribbean Sea at the top. All recommendations from the hosts were spot on. Would highly recommend renting a Small car. roads are not wide. but recently paved and safe.

47989817,Kenneth,December,2022,Everything was good
47989817,John,April,2022,"Great location. just a 5-10 min walk to surf/beaches. depending on your hill training regime.Small. tidy space.Nice porch. picnic table and bbq with views of lush plants in the valley below...and many birds. lizards live near by.Nice ""town"" of a few blocks length at the beach with most things you'd need for a fun time.Board rentals. small drink and snack Bodega at bottom of hill (gas station uphill a few blocks for more supplies). Grocery stores are assorted distances from here. A few casual places to eat and a few more upscale spots.A more relaxed area vs Rincon proper.Plenty of locals live in the neighborhood."
47989817,Aria,March,2022,Our stay was great. Very close to everything and easy to get to. The only issue was the neighbor‚Äôs rooster cries out starting at 4am until 4pm continuously. so if you are a light sleeper keep this in mind. The house itself was great and simple had everything we needed.
47989817,Hannah,March,2022,Amazing little studio place in a great location. Neighbors who live next door year round were incredibly nice and helpful!
47989817,Samuel,February,2022,Nice apartment with the essentials for a reasonable price in a very convenient part of town! Quiet area just up the hill from the beach and some restaurants. Would certainly come back to stay for a surf trip
47989817,Adrian,February,2022,Great place to stay and surf some of Rincon's best breaks!  Short walk to the beaches and food. lovely to hang out on the back deck.  The place is small but comfortable.  Fair warning (and not under the control of the landlord): there are many roosters next door that begin crowing at 4 am and often don't stop for most of the day.
47989817,Brian,January,2022,Great spot! Everything you need and a short walk to the beach and restaurants.
47989817,Tali,January,2022,Everything was clean and nice. Hosts super helpful. Short walk to the beach but a big hill. All around everything was great!

47989817,Anibal,July,2021,Great place and location. 100% recommend. Quiet. comfortable and close to beaches. restaurants and town bars. We are definitely coming back.

3360389,Stephanie,May,2022,BOOK THIS PLACE! We were so beyond happy with this stay and couldn‚Äôt have asked for more.  The view is incredible.  My fianc√© and I lived on the terrace.  The apartment is fully equipped with all your needs and the AC was impeccable.  After a full day on the beach the AC saved us.  Be mindful the property is on a hill and the driveway is very steep.  This is the case though for just about all homes in Rincon. seeing as how it‚Äôs a very hilly area.  The Big Kahuna bar is right downstairs and that was our quick go to spot.  The beach is just a 5 minute walk.  You are in a great location close to everything within a 5 minute radius.  Bottom line we would have extended our stay if possible!
3360389,Laura,May,2022,I loved staying here! Comfortable. clean. beautiful views.
3360389,Luis,November,2021,Great value and great view. Parking was easy and secure.
3360389,Richard,August,2021,Cons: Place could have been a lot cleaner. They had nail clipping on the side bed table. Closet shelves had caked on dust. Floor were dusty as well. Only provide 1 roll of paper toilet for 5 day stay.  Along with one kitchen trash bag. Internet didn‚Äôt work during our stay. Pros: Pool was clean.. convenient washer and dryer‚Äôs however there is a key card so you only pay for the wash and dry portion and location close to taboo and burger bar.. near Sandy Beach.
3360389,Sonia,August,2021,This place was amazing and had beautiful views of the ocean. Everything was clean and smelled good and it was close to everything we needed. Highly recommend this place and it‚Äôs just a short drive to town center and beaches
3360389,Anthony,August,2021,Make sure you guys take it easy on the road to this location. I got lost finding it at 1st but got there safely. The roads are narrow and people speeding up and down the road so take it easy and be safe.
3360389,Kasi,July,2021,Great location and great accommodations!
3360389,Response from Jennifer,June,2021,Thanks for your feedback
3360389,Myriam,June,2021,Dirty swimming pool. no electricity therefore no internet not able to closed electrical gate roaches.  very scared unable to sleep the worst experience ever can‚Äôt explain the frustration.
3360389,Matthew,June,2021,Pros:1. Close proximity to the beach2. Great view from the balcony and rooftop upstairsCons:1. Bugs easily get into the unit2. Need to supply your own toilet paper3. Gate to access parking lot does not have a sensor so you need to get out of the car each time to open the gate. 4. Do not book your stay here if you plan to have a small car that is low to the ground. The driveway is very steep and will scrape the bottom of your car. 5. Wifi doesn‚Äôt work well
3360389,Stephanie,May,2021,Great location and great for the price.
3360389,Kiersten,May,2021,Words cannot describe how incredible this stay was. Simply the view on the rooftop while sipping your morning coffee and gazing at the star filled sky at night was out of this world. This place was clean and comfortable. Fully equipped kitchen. there was a laundry if you needed. the pool was spectacular! Everything was wonderful! Lots of beautiful beaches. amazing food. grocery stores. the plaza within minutes driving. The location was amazing! I would highly recommend this place if you‚Äôre planning to visit rincon!
3360389,Response from Jennifer,May,2021,Thank you so much!  We hope to have you back soon.
3360389,Joseph,April,2021,Beautiful views. steps from the beach. would definitely stay again!
3360389,Jacqueline,April,2021,Gorgeous Airbnb in Rincon. A little hard to get to when you first get in. but it‚Äôs absolutely worth it. The views are stunning and it‚Äôs a 5 min walk to the beach.
3360389,Connor,April,2021,Great location. view from balcony was incredible. The town is very cool. Great host. super responsive. Definitely. definitely will be back.
3360389,Response from Jennifer,April,2021,Hi. If there were any issues it should have been informed to us as soon as you arrived. We sent you a message the next day to ask if all was good and you never replied. You never told us you left before. This is very strange and just seems like you are trying to get your money back after your stay.  Our place has 53 reviews with 4.43 stars. You are making this request for the first time 2 weeks after your departure.Show more

3360389,Mike,February,2021,Great spot with the best location. Not my first time staying here and not my last!
3360389,Antonio,November,2020,This place sit atop of a hill and has a really amazing view of the north coast of Rincon. It is very close to the beach and to nice lil restaurants. you might need a car to get around Rincon. The apartment is located at a complex with many other rental apartments. but it has 2 parking spots conveniently located right in front of the door. The decoration of the apartment may seem a bit outdated to some people and the Wi-fi was super slow and weak.  The A/C remote control was broken. but Jennifer was very responsive and brought a new one asap.  The bed was very very comfy.
3360389,Jean Paul,November,2020,We loved it!!

3360389,Yariel,July,2020,Great place and great views
3360389,Ashley,July,2020,The place is really nice. Has a great view BUT call ahead of time. We got to the penthouse and we realized the pool was not working. They told us that it will be up and running early the next morning and that was not true. AT ALL. We had to wait 2 days to be able to use the pool. Our stay was for 3 days. We could only use the pool the same morning of check out. Its such a nice place but communication is key during these times. We chose this AirBnB because it has a pool and it would be great to stay away from exposure as much as possible. It saddened us to see that we couldn't do much other than wait for the pool to fill up. FYI We are going through a pandemic. all the beaches are closed too.

3360389,Christine,January,2020,Great condo with AMAZING views.  The balcony and rooftop offered plenty of outdoor space.  A beautiful breeze blew through the apartment during the day.  Beds in both bedrooms were very comfortable.  The location was perfect - just a short walk down the hill to the beach. bars and restaurants.  Jennifer was very quick to respond anytime I had a question.  Can't wait to visit again!
3360389,Response from Jennifer,July,2019,Unfortunately. we do not know or have control over when power outages happen and the HOA does not allow generators in the condominium.

The ceiling and apartment have been completely painted and we communicated with you all the time.

3360389,Jonathan,September,2018,Perfect place for a quick getaway. It was clean. comfortable. had a great view on the balcony and terrace.  walking distance from Sandy Beach. and a nice infinity pool.Jennifer was prompt to answer our questions.
3360389,Karin,June,2018,The Puntas area of Rincon is a gem on the west coast of the island.  The Villas provide one of the best views of the area available.   Here you will have quick access to Sandy beach. Pools beach. Kahuna burger. Tamboo. and The Red Flamboyan.  They are all wonderful spots with amazing staff and great food.Contact with hosts at the Villas was easy.   They actually speedily delivered us a key to the pool when it was discovered we didn‚Äôt have one.   The place is clean and in good condition.  I have to add that I am very particular about mattresses and the ones here were extremely comfortable.Don‚Äôt pay more than you have to in this prime area.   Everything you need is here.
3360389,Response from Jennifer,June,2018,Chris. because of the open terrace and it being rainy season the roof just started to leak. There were guests that left a 5 star review just 5 days before your arrival. Sorry for any inconvenience.

31626667,Maria,January,2022,The view from the terrace is amazing! And the view from the balcony of the apartment was also amazing. We enjoyed relaxing on the terrace. It is a great escape from urban life. We stayed in the one bedroom. There was plenty of hot water.  The bed was comfortable. The place was clean and the location was convenient for us. We did have a car. Concerns and questions were answered very quickly.
31626667,Martin,August,2021,Dujardin‚Äôs place was great amd justbas described. We stayed at one of the many rooms at terrace at Rincon. in the 1 bedroom. It was a perfect place for my wife and I to work all week and enjoy evenings in Rincon. Rincon itself is amazing and had that country vibe unlike San Juan. The sunsets on the rooftop terrace and the pool onsite were amazing. I guess we came off Swain so we had the whole place to ourselves. It was great to have a gym as well that Dujardin is building up. Great also to have laundry onsite. Overall. a great time. I‚Äôm looking forward to bringing my entire extended family with me next time and take over the whole terrace at Rincon and enjoy this side of Puerto Rico called Rincon.
31626667,Response from Dujardin,May,2021,It was a delight being a host to such a wonderful guest-- friendly. courteous and adventurous!  Looking forward to having her back on her upcoming trip.  I highly recommend Yvette to any Airbnb host!

44169079,Spencer,November,2020,In all my years of using AirBnB Daniel was the single friendliest host ive encountered. He proactively reached out to make sure I could find the place.  drove into town to let me in and offered all sort of local tips. If anything. I felt as if his sparse pictures actually undersold the place and it‚Äôs beautiful communal areas and roof deck. I will definitely return!

34394595,LinkJohn,November,2022,Excellent communication. great location!!
34394595,Xavier,September,2022,Great location and attention from host!
34394595,Carmen,July,2022,Excellent location and space!! We hade such a peacefully stay.
34394595,Marie,June,2022,We stayed as a family of 6 adults and 2 children. The space is great. the bedrooms are a good size and all of them have A/C units. great for getting a restful night after a bunch of outdoor activities during the day. Having multiple bathrooms made it super easy to get ready for the day and  washing off from daily activities. This property also gives you a great location and amazing views. The BBQ area was our favorite. we spent most of our time there. Communication with Sooz was super easy and accurate. We will definitely keep this property as our first choice when going back to the area.
34394595,Gina,June,2022,The house was very comfortable for 8 people.  Rooms were spacious with plenty of closet space . night stand and dresser in master room.  Master room has own bathroom with 2 sinks. shower. closet and private patio with view of ocean.  There were plenty of towels.  Kitchen was supplied well including water/ice machine on refrigerator. Patio was comfortable and furnished with 2 grill. chairs and hammock.   The view  of the ocean was a plus.  The bedrooms were air conditioned that worked well.  Working washer and dryer a plus.  Beds were comfortable. Beach amenities were supplied suck as beach towels. chairs. umbrella.   I would suggest have a cooler available for future guests. Recommend the beach house restaurant. Can see the sunset from the lounge chairs supplied. Good good but on the expensive side. We preferred to cook and stay In for meals
34394595,Jose,May,2022,This was a beautiful house where you will definitely be comfortable. The view is great! The host is super responsive. You definitely need a car to get around. Parking is provided. so that worked out great!
34394595,Lisa,December,2021,Casa Pi√±a was large and comfortable with plenty of space to move around and hang out. The porches. particularly the back facing the water. was the best part of being there. Sooz was very attentive to our needs and suggestions for improvements. We will definitely consider renting again when we return to PR!
34394595,Jessica,November,2021,We had a wonderful stay in Rincon and the house was great. Large. clean. very good location and our favorite was the top floor porch.  We hope to return next year.
34394595,Luis,August,2021,If you‚Äôre looking for a spacious place with beautiful views and located close to everything. this is the place.
34394595,Crystina,June,2021,Amazing house. amazing location! We will definitely visit again!
34394595,Jennifer,June,2021,We really enjoyed this place. Beds were comfortable and showers were awesome. It had a really good vibe. Beach towels for everyone to use. Drive to beach less than 8 minutes. Balconies were exceptional. We spent most of out time there. Air conditioner in bedrooms very cool.  We were a party of 10 from New Orleans.
34394595,Alma,April,2021,The location of the house is excellent. close to everything.  The super big and spacious house.  It is equipped to cook. barbecue or to stay there completely relaxed.  It has the best beaches nearby. the Lighthouse and food places.  A very comfortable house.  Everything completely clean.  The wifi worked. the tv didn't.  The communication with the host. was excellent. Best of all. it's pet friendly.
34394595,Response from James,September,2020,Thank you for the review. Elisha. We greatly appreciated your stay. We were unable to stop the leak during your stay because it was coming from a pipe inside the ceiling. Our plumber was aware of this prior to your stay. though we were not experiencing it as heavily before your arrival. The soonest the plumber could come with an extra contractor. who would use a camera internally to find leaks in the pipes. was the day after your check out. My apologies if this was not communicated to you. I had seen a missed call from you during your stay. I called the number back and sent a follow up text. but never heard a response back. I was unaware that  you were disappointed about this. and wanted to reach out to let you know I understand how frustrating of an experience a leak can be. I am very happy that it was not accumulating water. and it was more of a slow leak. but I can still see how it can cause discomfort. Thankfully it was in the spare bedroom of laundry. and it's helpful knowing you were able to utilize the other restrooms efficiently.   There is not much we can do about the service in the area. There is just a very delicate infrastructure in the area. It's so remote. which makes it so beautiful. but there will always be delays in technology because of that. I'm always happy to help guests find the home. and I was happy to help to do.   Thank you.Show more
34394595,Daphne,September,2020,The place is really great with an espectacular view and the house t so warming the only thing is that the WiFi and tv never worked.
34394595,Valeria,July,2020,Great place at Rincon to stay with the family with a beautiful view
34394595,Aimee,March,2020,We loved Sooz‚Äôs house!  We will definitely stay here again in the future.  To explain my lower score about check-in. this was a misunderstanding but something Airbnb users should be aware of.  The door code instructions were texted to the phone number attached to my Airbnb account.  I stopped using that number years ago and I use Airbnb all the time.  This had never come up.  I contacted Sooz via messaging in Airbnb to ask for the code but didn‚Äôt get a reply so we could not check in our first night.  We landed very late and Sooz‚Äôs cell phone was off. Airbnb took 3.5 hours to answer the call.  Sooz was very accommodating and apologetic but just be sure you establish good communication before you arrive as Airbnb does not have her door codes.  Even with this issue we all loved it and will stay there again.
34394595,Maite,September,2019,Excellent views and location! Near beaches and night life.  Big open spaces.  Great communication!
34394595,Juan,August,2022,House very close to the beach. very clean and excellent host.Translated from Spanish¬†¬†Show original
